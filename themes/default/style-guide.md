# Style Guide
This document defines some general styles we adhere to in the docs.

## Words are important

- Instead of _guys_ try _folks_, _yall_, or _everyone_
- Instead of _crazy_ try _wild_
- Instead of _click_ use _select_
- Instead of _dummy_ use _placeholder_
- Avoid using gendered language
- Avoid using violent language (e.g., _kill_)
- Avoid pop-culture references

## Headings

- You should be able to scan the headings of a document and get a good sense of the page
- Every page should have exactly one h1
- Never skip a heading level, e.g., if your previous heading level was a 2, the next heading can be a 2 or a 3, but not a 4 or 5

## Links

- Link text should be descriptive and be understandable outside of the context that it is in.
- Avoid link text like _here_, _click here_, _see here_

## Notes and Warning

- Use notes to communicate important information
- Try and limit the use of notes within a single page
- Use info for general information, and warnings for more important information

### Example

```
{{% notes type="info" %}}
This is a info note.
{{% /notes %}}

{{% notes type="warning" %}}
This is a warning  note.
{{% /notes %}}
```

## Quotes

- Use quotes only when you are quoting a person.

### Example

> This is something a person said.
