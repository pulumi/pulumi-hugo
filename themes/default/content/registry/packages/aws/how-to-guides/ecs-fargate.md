In this tutorial, we'll build and publish a Docker container to a private Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and spin up a load-balanced Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Fargate service, all in a handful of lines of code, using [Pulumi Crosswalk for AWS](/docs/guides/crosswalk/aws/).

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Docker Engine - Community](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
1. [Install Pulumi](/docs/install/)
1. [Configure Pulumi to use your AWS account](/registry/packages/aws/installation-configuration/)

## Deploy the App

### Step 1: Create a new project from a template

Create a project directory, `hello-fargate`, and change into it. Run [`pulumi new aws-typescript --name myproject`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_new/) to create a new project using the AWS template for TypeScript. Replace `myproject` with your desired project name.

Run `pulumi new` to create a new project:

```bash
$ mkdir hello-fargate && cd hello-fargate
$ pulumi new aws-typescript --name myproject
```

### Step 2: Build the Dockerized app

Create a subdirectory, `app`, which will contain your sample Dockerized application. From the `app` subdirectory, add the following files:

#### **Dockerfile**

```docker
FROM nginx
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### **index.html**

```html
<html>
  <head><meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello Fargate</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p>Hello AWS Fargate!</p>
      <p>Made with ❤️ with <a href="https://pulumi.com">Pulumi</a></p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Create the ECS cluster

Replace the contents of `index.ts` with the following:

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import * as awsx from "@pulumi/awsx";
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";

// An ECS cluster to deploy into.
const cluster = new aws.ecs.Cluster("cluster", {});
```

### Step 4: Create the load balancer

Add the following lines to `index.ts`:

```typescript
// Create a load balancer to listen for requests and route them to the container.
const loadbalancer = new awsx.lb.ApplicationLoadBalancer("loadbalancer", {});
```

### Step 5: Define the service and publish the Docker image

Add the following lines to `index.ts`:

```typescript

// Create the ECR repository to store our container image
const repo = new awsx.ecr.Repository("repo", {
    forceDelete: true,
});

// Build and publish our application's container image from ./app to the ECR repository.
const image = new awsx.ecr.Image("image", {
    repositoryUrl: repo.url,
    path: "./app",
});

// Define the service and configure it to use our image and load balancer.
const service = new awsx.ecs.FargateService("service", {
    cluster: cluster.arn,
    assignPublicIp: true,
    taskDefinitionArgs: {
        container: {
            name: "awsx-ecs",
            image: image.imageUri,
            cpu: 128,
            memory: 512,
            essential: true,
            portMappings: [{
                containerPort: 80,
                targetGroup: loadbalancer.defaultTargetGroup,
            }],
        },
    },
});

// Export the URL so we can easily access it.
export const frontendURL = pulumi.interpolate `http://${loadbalancer.loadBalancer.dnsName}`;
```

You just created an automatic cluster in the default AWS VPC to run a Fargate service.

### Step 6: Verify your app structure

In addition to the `node_modules` directory and related npm package files, ensure you have the following directory structure:

```
Pulumi.yaml
index.ts
app/
  Dockerfile
  index.html
```

### Step 7: Set your AWS region

Configure the AWS region you would like to use:

```bash
$ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-1
```

### Step 8: Preview and deploy your resources

To preview your Pulumi program, run [`pulumi up`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_up/). The command shows a preview of the resources that will be created and prompts you to proceed with the deployment.  Note that the stack itself is counted as a resource, though it does not correspond to a physical cloud resource.

```bash
$ pulumi up
Previewing update (dev)
...
Do you want to perform this update? yes
Updating (dev)
...
Diagnostics:
  awsx:x:ecs:FargateTaskDefinition (nginx):
  ...

Outputs:
    frontendURL: "http://nginx-4c517b3-c98ba6a1e62b644e.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/"

Resources:
    + 32 created

Duration: 3m39s
```

The deployment takes a few minutes. With your `pulumi up` invocation, Pulumi automatically does the following for you:

- Build and provision a container registry using ECR
- Build the Docker image
- Push the resulting image to the repository

### Step 9: Test the resulting load balancer URL

Now that you've deployed your app, confirm that the service is working via `curl`.

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output frontendURL)
<html>
    <head><meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Hello Fargate</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello, containers!</p>
        <p>Made with ❤️ with <a href="https://pulumi.com">Pulumi</a></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Step 10: View container logs (Optional)

To view the runtime logs from the container, use the [`pulumi logs`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_logs/) command. To get a log stream, use `pulumi logs --follow`.

```bash
$ pulumi logs --follow
Collecting logs for stack dev since 2021-03-26T10:49:57.000-07:00.
