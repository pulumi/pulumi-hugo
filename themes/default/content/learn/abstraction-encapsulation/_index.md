## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading
speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about 25
minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to complete this pathway:

- A [Pulumi account and
  token]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/accounts#access-tokens" >}})
  - If you don't have an account, go to the [signup
    page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).
- An AWS account (the free version should be fine)

In addition, you should be able to
- code in Python

We recommend that you either have completed [Pulumi
Fundamentals]({{< relref "/learn/pulumi-fundamentals" >}}) and [Building with
Pulumi]({{< relref "/learn/building-with-pulumi" >}}) OR have experience using
Pulumi for other projects.

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you can use Pulumi as a tool to help you
abstract and encapsulate your resource definitions as reusable models for others
to use.

Note that this pathway will not have as many code samples to use as we will be
defining patterns, exploring architecture, and discussing resources.
