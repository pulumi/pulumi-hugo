## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about 25 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to complete this pathway:

- A [Pulumi account and token]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/accounts#access-tokens" >}})
  - If you don't have an account, go to the [signup page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).
- An AWS account (the free version should be fine)

In addition, you should be able to
- code in Python

We recommend that you either have completed [Pulumi Fundamentals]({{< relref "/learn/pulumi-fundamentals" >}}) and [Building with Pulumi]({{< relref "/learn/building-with-pulumi" >}}) OR have experience using Pulumi for other projects.

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you can use Pulumi as a tool to help you abstract and encapsulate your resource definitions as reusable models for others to use.

Note that this pathway will not have as many code samples to use as other pathways. We will be defining patterns, exploring architecture, and discussing resources.
