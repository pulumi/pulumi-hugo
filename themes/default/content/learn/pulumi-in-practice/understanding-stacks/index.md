Every Pulumi program is deployed to a stack. A stack is an isolated, independently [configurable](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/config/) instance of a Pulumi program. Stacks are commonly used to denote different phases of development (such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`) or feature branches (such as `feature-x-dev`).

A project can have as many stacks as you need. By default, Pulumi creates a stack for you when you start a new project using the `pulumi new` command. Let's create a new project now for use in this tutorial:

{{< chooser language "typescript,python,go,csharp" / >}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
$ pulumi new typescript -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
$ pulumi new python -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
$ pulumi new go -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
$ pulumi new csharp -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

This prints output similar to the following with a bit more information and status as it goes:

```
Created stack 'dev'
...
Your new project is ready to go! âœ¨
To perform an initial deployment, run 'pulumi up'
```
## Create a stack
To create a new stack, we use the command `pulumi stack init stackName`. This creates an empty stack `stackName` and sets it as the _active_ stack. The project that the stack is associated with is determined by finding the nearest `Pulumi.yaml` file.

The stack name must be unique within a project. Stack names may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, or periods.

Let's create a new stack in our project, for our staging environment:

{{< chooser language "typescript,python,go,csharp" / >}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack init staging
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack init staging
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack init staging
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack init staging
```

{{% /choosable %}}

## Listing Stacks
We have a couple of stacks in our project now - but how do we know which ones we have? If we run the command `pulumi stack ls` it will tell us!

```bash
$ pulumi stack ls
NAME      LAST UPDATE  RESOURCE COUNT  URL
dev       n/a          n/a             https://app.pulumi.com/***/my-first-app/dev
staging*  n/a          n/a             https://app.pulumi.com/***/my-first-app/staging
```
Notice that the `staging` stack has an `*` after its name; this marks this as the active stack (i.e., the stack that all our commands will run on).
## Selecting Stacks

When we run a pulumi command (such as `config`, `up`, or `destroy`) this operates on the *active* stack. But what if we want to change which stack is active? For this, we use the `pulumi stack select` command:

```bash
$ pulumi stack select dev

$ pulumi stack ls
NAME     LAST UPDATE     RESOURCE COUNT  URL
dev*     n/a             n/a             https://app.pulumi.com/***/my-first-app/dev
staging  n/a             n/a             https://app.pulumi.com/***/my-first-app/staging
```

Notice that `dev` is now the active stack.
