## Definition

A type of database that does not store its data in tables. Also called non-relational databases, NoSQL databases can be document-based (like MongoDB), column-based (like Apache Cassandra), graph-based (like Neo4j), or key-value (like DynamoDB). Other flavors of NoSQL databases do exist, including hybrids, but these are the most commonly-used.
