Infrastructure in Pulumi is organized into _projects_. In the Pulumi ecosystem,
a project represents a Pulumi _program_ that, when run, declares the desired
infrastructure for Pulumi to manage. The program has corresponding _stacks_, or
isolated, independently configurable instances of your Pulumi program. We'll
talk more about stacks later in the [Building with
Pulumi]({{< relref "/learn/building-with-pulumi" >}}) pathway.

## Create a directory

Each Pulumi project lives in its own directory. Create one now and change into
it by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

Pulumi will use the directory name as your project name by default. To create an
independent project, name the directory differently.

## Initialize your project

Since a Pulumi project is just a directory with some files in it, it is possible
for you to create a new one by hand. The `pulumi new` command-line interface
(CLI) command, however, automates the process and ensures you have everything
you need, so let's use that command. Use Python for this tutorial (TypeScript,
Go, and C# are coming soon!), and the `-y` flag answers "yes" to the prompts to
create a default project:

{{< chooser language "typescript,python" / >}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ pulumi new typescript -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ pulumi new python -y
```

{{% /choosable %}}

This command prints output similar to the following example with a bit more
information and status as it goes (this example is in Python, but the basics
are the same for any language):

```bash
Created stack 'dev'

Creating virtual environment...

Finished creating virtual environment

Updating pip, setuptools, and wheel in virtual environment...
...
Your new project is ready to go! âœ¨

To perform an initial deployment, run 'pulumi up'
```

This command creates all the files we need, initializes a new stack named `dev`
(an instance of our project), and installs any necessary dependencies.

## Inspect your new project

The basic project created by `pulumi new` is comprised of multiple files:

* `Pulumi.yaml`: your project's metadata, containing its name and language
* {{< langfile >}}: your program's main entrypoint file

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

* `package.json`: your project's Node.js dependency information

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

* `requirements.txt`: your project's Python dependency information
* `venv`: a [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) for your project

{{% /choosable %}}

Use the command <code>cat</code>{{< langfile >}} to explore the contents of your
project's empty program:

{{< chooser language "typescript,python" / >}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```typescript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```python
"""A Python Pulumi program"""

import pulumi
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Feel free to explore the other files, although we won't be editing any of them
by hand.

Let's move on to creating your first real bit of infrastructure with Pulumi:
some Docker images.
