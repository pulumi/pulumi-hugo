One of the biggest advantages of using Pulumi for Cloud Engineering is using the
language features of your favorite programming languages. For example, we can
break the Pulumi program you currently have in {{% langfile %}} into other files
and call them from the main file. We will be exploring more features like
testing in some later tutorials on other pathways, so we are going to prepare
our code here.
