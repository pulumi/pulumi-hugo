transcript: |
    We can get started with some introductions actually. OK. Uh So everyone, thank you so much for joining our webinar today. My name is Paul Stack. Uh I'm from Pulumi. I'm one of the software engineers here uh with me, I'm very delighted to say I have Trevor. Trevor. Would you like to introduce yourself? Yeah. Hey, everyone. Trevor Kennedy here. I'm one of the uh solution architects in the Americas for I. So I work with kind of customers and prospective customers, sort of evaluate our technology and get up and running on the platform. So pleasure to speak with everyone today. And as you can see from the title of the webinar, it's built in with any language, any cloud and any open source database. So it's, it's a very interesting topic uh by bringing these two technologies together. And uh I'm very looking forward to like seeing some of the it side of things. So today you'll learn how Pulumi simplifies infrastructure deployments, uh how I even simplifies database provision and management and then how basically these two systems work really well together to be able to uh use your databases across multiple clouds. Um uh Use any languages that you, that you actually wanted, as we said, I'm Paul and we have Trevor. Uh you can find our uh Twitter details right here. I'm hoping that's Trevor's Twitter. It is. Ok, good. Just checking, just checking. Um ok. And then we can get started. So uh we're very much in the era of the cloud transition uh today and uh actually like event, the COVID event in general has actually accelerated that cloud transition. And there are people at different sort of levels, different parts, different variants of that cloud transition. You have some people who are very much dipping their toe in the cloud infrastructure work where they, they've effectively picked up their database and their uh infrastructure apps and they've moved to the cloud, it's very private, it's very end tier and it's maybe a, a small part of their system is actually running in the cloud. It's, it's, it's, it's uh usually backed by a load balancer or something or a direct connect into the data center. And uh it's, it's, it's an experimental approach in uh for the cloud, you have people who have gone a little further or, or maybe skip that step completely. And they're in this sort of transitional world between um V MS and containers and it's a hybrid of public private cloud, they're possibly taking advantage of some hosted uh services, some, some uh platforms of service, maybe some uh monitoring tools or some. And it's, it's it's really starting to bring together a lot of different uh parts of, of the ecosystem. And then you have people who have gone um way beyond that and, and here we call it a V three architecture or a modern architecture. You've probably heard terms like cloud native or a or SOA or all these different things. And it's effectively a fully dynamic system. It's, it's, it's very um interconnected between systems and like things like uh function as a service Lambda. You know, you're probably taking advantage of uh container hypervisor, uh more than likely Kubernetes in this space at this minute because it's, you know, it's, it's very popular, it's very prevalent and it's a mostly public cloud system and um you can kind of test at what point you're at um in this system by being able to try and run your entire system on your local machine. And if you're, if you're here, you can build that and run it, you know, quite successfully using maybe containers or, you know, the physical databases. If you're starting to take advantage of a bit more fast based things, then your, your database will, I mean, excuse me, your local development machine will need to talk about to other services. And if you're in um a fully modern hyper Dyna hyper connected uh way with taking advantage of things like Lambda or Azure functions, then it becomes a wee bit more difficult for um to be able to run the entire parts of your system together. DeVos has effectively transformed everything. OK. It used to be that the operations team were the gatekeepers to everything that happened within an it organization. And uh it, it, it meant that they were the keepers of, of uh new systems going out. They were the keepers of new technologies being introduced. And uh it, it, it was very difficult for a long time in order to actually work with them. Uh The war story here is that I, I actually worked for a company that uh used to pay um the operations team based on up time. And because they were based on up time, they were, they were very difficult and very hesitant to release any new features or any new systems that the the developers wanted to until they were rigorously checked uh for weeks and weeks by the operations team. And it became very difficult in order to, to actually, you know, change our ecosystem devops has, as I said, transformed everything and the operations team are now the central uh Linchpin in driving everything forward. So they're starting to create the tooling. They're starting to making sure that they work with the applications team to bring in monitoring tools, they're working with the security team in order to bring the security um aspect to everything that we're doing. And at Pulumi, we're starting to call this cloud engineering. OK. So it's, it's taken one step further than devops. And it's actually bringing all of these concepts together, related to delivering the system rather than the communication patterns between them. In getting here. We, we understand that there are, there have been multiple ways of managing clouds in the past. OK. We had the web console where you would click around and you would provision a few services. It was very, it, it, it is very hard to scale. Um It's limited to like a, a set of users because people would stamp over the top of each other and it just is, is more for getting started and, and, and working through this, then you have people who have moved beyond that, they've gone to CL I tool and, and templates, things like cloud formation as your resource manager, cloud deployment manager where you have much more improved automation and, and uh version and, but we usability and updates are hard. So you can't really create layers of abstraction. And then you've got people who have moved um to using code infrastructure is code and you're setting up your resources just like you're writing and releasing your software where you're able to create these layers of abstraction through um API S or through modules and you're starting to understand best practices around everything that's there. So what is polluting? Where does it come in? Pulumi, we actually like to say we're modern infrastructure is code. So we're able to embed infrastructure as code with uh your familiar program and languages and your tooling and your I DS and all your setups. It's uh open source, it works with any cloud and of course, as per any product, it's, it has a paid for aspect as, as well as um, what's going on here. And, uh, when I say it works with any cloud, we have today over 50 providers. Um So we have Amazon Azure, Kubernetes Fast. I uh we have cloud AM QP. We have actual database drivers, network drivers, we support no jazz go uh any of the dot net core languages, typescript, javascript and Python, which means that you get full runtime integration with your I DS and your tools. And of course, because it's a cli based tool um based on your, your ops familiarity, you can embed it into your C A CD workflow. So we believe that we're trying to drive infrastructure forward to the next level and try and give people that ability to create this proper um proper experience around building and deploying and managing your infrastructure in exactly the same way that you will have to do with your uh software itself. Trevor. Yeah, let me um do you want me, you want me to, to share my screen? Do you want to continue to, I am going to give it, you can drive. All right. See, are you seeing, are you seeing the slides over here? Perfect Miguel. Yeah. So um I wanna kind of continue on the messaging here. Uh you know, so the Plumy works with a lot of your favorite tools, you know, ecosystem tool, cloud providers and so forth and, and that really sort of parlays nicely into what Ivan does. So Ivan lets you use the open source databases of your choice on the cloud of your choice in the region of your choice. We have a worldwide footprint, we have, you know, 24 by seven operations for the support and also our technical ops and maintenance uh functionality. We work with five different cloud providers in 90 plus different regions around the world and we are over 100 and 50 employees total and much like much like Pulumi, our mission is just to simply make developers lives easier. Um Everyone wants to use the sort of the latest tooling, the best and newest open source projects. Um But let's be, let's be honest, it's kind of a challenge to get those products up and running it, a challenge to get them sort of running in a really highly available manner in a cost and performance manner. Uh And we sort of abstract all those details away from you, you have your endpoint and you can't connect to it. It's, it's that simple and you know, as we think about shifting to the cloud, uh I think this is kind of an interesting stat because it's not just moving from on premise to cloud, it's actually moving from on premise to multiple clouds. And this recent uh this recent report here shows that roughly 92% of organizations are actually pursuing a multi cloud strategy. And again, when you think about supporting not just one cloud but multiple clouds that adds another layer of complexity that you have to sort of manage and it's just, it's, it's no bueno. Um you know, so when you think about sort of evaluating these sort of different database uh technologies and offerings across various sort of point. So solutions and hyper scalars. Uh I want you to think about the fact that Ivan offers you sort of a wide, a wide swath to choose from under one single roof. So Kafka Post Grass, my Elastic Search, Reddi Time series databases like UBERS M three and N flux DB, you can all spin them up in, in one place and move them from one cloud to another without incurring any data transfer costs or any downtime in that process. Uh So just to kind of recap basically the Ivan platform, it runs on top of the cloud provider of your choice. So Aws Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean and up cloud 90 plus different regions, we perform the sort of the care and feeding of that. We spin up the infrastructure and spin them down. Um Everything is we're an API first company. So you can just hit the API to do it. You can use our web based, which I'll demo that as well, we have command line to learn for doing it. And you can also use the plume provider to provision resources as well. And we'll demo that uh in a second. Uh Finally, we provide the tool to make it really easy to migrate from one region to another or even from one cloud to another. And again, those are zero downtown operations. No data transfer costs. It's all baked into the uh the hourly pricing for our services. Same with scaling really easy to scale up from a single instance to really beefy multi multi node instances that scale multiple availability zones and even multiple regions uh in some cases. And again, it's all super simple to do through our tooling. Um And then likewise much like Pulumi, we sort of pride ourselves in being um sort of good sort of partners and really easy to integrate with your existing ecosystem. So whether that's whether you're using tools like data dog or, or Splunk for Prometheus using uh elastic search or anything that's a clog compatible, really easy to turn on those integrations in the console. Uh You know, we have industry leading, you know, 99.99% slas actually the observed up time is closer to 99.997% over the past three years. Um You know, all these sort of compliance and sort of security tooling that you would expect is also supported. So with that, let's actually switch into something that's a little bit more fun. Uh So let me go ahead and share my screen here and Paul, if you can confirm that you can see my screen, that would be great. Yeah, I can see. OK. Wonderful. So this is uh the Ivan console, web based console. Very quickly. You want to highlight a couple of things before you dig into the code. Um First, if you do want to spin up an instance, uh It's just as simple as choosing your database type, I'll do my sequel. In this case, I will then choose the region. You know what let's go with Digital Ocean today. Uh I'm in the US. So I'm gonna do New York City that's probably closest to me. I can then choose from teeny tiny plans will start at, you know, under $20 a month to really beefy plans, uh you know, high availability sets, um you know, terabytes of storage in this case, going to do something a little bit more modest uh to serve, serve resources here. Um Give it a name he create and we're gonna see it spin up here. So now we see it, the instance is actually spilling up, spinning up. We can see the region of the choice again if I wanted to go through here and create an integration, like let's say the dog for instance and click this, I have my data dog api key already in my account. And that's as simple as that. I now have my, I can monitor this instance with data dog. Um Likewise, if I wanted to move it from one cloud to another, let's say, you know what actually or my organization is moving from Digital Ocean to GCP, I can then go in here and click GCP US central and we'll see that migration is gonna start to happen. We have, we have the blue node saying that it's gonna be migrated over. So with that act, let's actually flip over to the console here. Um So I wanna do two things. First of all, I'm gonna show um I just hit, pull me up here to get this started because it does take a few moments to get things provisioned. Just give it a second here. So we can see that the stack output from Pulumi. We're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to provision an M three time series database instance. We're going to provision a Lambda function. We're also going to create a graph instance and we're gonna connect uh Grana and M three as a data source. So we can actually see data coming in. Um And let me flip over to digit to VS code. If I, if I get the right window open here, here it is. So if we look at the actual code I'm using Python, in this case, Trevor, I'm so sorry. Could you just increase this, the font size? Oh, sure. Yeah. Um bit of an eye chart, huh? How about now? Perfect. Thank you so much. Ok, great. Yeah, let me just change my window sizes here. Yeah, so, so pretty simple here. Um to create the the M three database engine itself, I have a little helper function, but basically I've imported the Ivan library, the Ivan Plume library. Uh I then say, hey, create the a database of type M three and I pass in the name of the service, the product, the project name, the cloud provider and region. I like to spin this up and, and then I can also choose the size of the plan as well. Um And then I have another helper function to export the details. Um And in addition to that, because actually, you know, I kind of like to show some data coming into this thing. I'm using the, the Ivan sorry, the uh AWS library for Pulumi, I've bring that into my project. And then I'm creating a LAMBDA function with the various IM and policies that it needs to have. Um cloud cloud watch actually executed on a sort of with every 62nd basis. Um I'm actually bringing in the uh the resource, the service UR I of the M three database and attaching this as environmental variable in the lambda function so that my Python code can actually pick it up and connect to the database. Uh Finally, I have my, I've created my lambda trigger rule. Um which in this case, it just basically it's cloudwatch uh event that's actually triggering it. And then finally, I'm going to create my integration and stand by while I plug in my old my laptop. Yeah. And then finally to integrate M three with Hanna. So we can actually graph it again using the Ivan um library. It's just one command to actually do that, the integration. So let's go back over to the uh terminal here. Let's see. OK. I have a couple of things I've created and a couple of things are still in progress. All right. So let's pause that for a second. Uh And let's flip over to the next demo that I wanna show. Let me get the right FUS window here open. OK. So this is the second project that I've created. Um In this case, what I wanted to highlight is the ability to do not just multi region postgres instances and read replicas, but multi cloud postgres instances and read replicas. So very easy to, I'm just defining this in code. I could have used the configuration variables to do this, but in this case, I'm just gonna do it in code. And again, pass, I'm gonna pass into the Plum Ivan library, you know the name of the master and the name of the read replicas and I'm gonna pass in the region that I want them to spin up. So I'm gonna do the master in Google. I'm gonna do a read replica in Azure and a read replica and AWS. Um This is this code snippet. It's, it's pretty, pretty similar. Again, I have created this sort of helper class to sort of, you know, pass in some of the configuration parameters, so I don't have to do it every time. Um And then I have a four loop that actually creates the master and the read replicas. And by the way, this code sample, actually, both these code samples are on the Ivan Github Repo and we can send links to folks afterwards. Um So let me go back over to the terminal here and actually ran this already ran this in advance. You can see that it's created the masters and the read replicas. Um It's mashed the passwords, which I think is good. Uh So let me go to my actually demo script to actually show that these replicas actually work and the data is actually being replicated across the clouds. So I have a very simple uh function here where a script here where I'm using um the faker library to actually generate some fake data. I'm going to then insert a bunch of records into the master node. Uh Again, I do this in batch mode that's roughly 1000 times. Uh And then I'm going to read. So you have my bro count function that I'm actually gonna read from the read replica to see if the record counts match between the two instances. So let me do. Uh let me do two things. One I created the um instances, but you know what I need to actually export these as a variable. So let me do if I do plu me stuck out. But so again, so again, so I can see that things are if you can just raise your size, your text size. Sorry. Thank you. This or even more. That's perfect. That sounds good. OK. Yeah. So let me go ahead and set up a couple of local um environment variables. So actually I can actually run my import script. And again, I need the master and a read replica, just environmental variables using the uh the stack output and then I can run it, just run that py. So it's inserting 1000 records into the master and then it's got the road and then it got the road count from the Rebeka and sure enough they match. So again, it was we inserted 1000 records and postgres instance in one cloud and then we migrated that over or duplicated that data over to Postgres instance in the second cloud and you know, it happened lightning fast and it's really that easy. Um Now let me go to OK, great. So let me flip back over to my console. Um Let's see. Let me change the font size. Is this a little bit easier to read or still want more font? A tiny bit more if you can OK, something like that. All right. So going back to my second demo, uh looks like M three has been created. Looks like the Ghana instance has been created. Looks like my lambda function has been created. Uh So let me flip over to the Ivan console here. And so sure enough, I see my M three instance is actually running here. I can click to reveal the user name, password to connect to it. Um Let me go back to my graph fauna instance. And let's see, let's actually connect to. Uh actually let me do this a little bit differently because I need the password. Me get the password here. OK. So let me log into Hanna. Let me go to explore. So you can see it right at the top here that I've been there. A data set has been, our data source has been connected to M three. If I then go to metrics, I can see uh this outside temperature value. Let me go ahead and to change something to a little bit more reasonable last five minutes. And sure enough, I can see the outside temperature values being sort of uh randomly inserted every yeah, it looks like every minute or so. Let me go back to my code so I can show you, let me just dive into the lambda function here real quick. So good thing about M three is that it's uh compatible with the influx DB line. Protocol format, which is essentially a, a CS V value in essence. Um And I just wanna show this is like, it really is just maybe eight lines of code less because I have comments in here to, you know, pick up the, the endpoint via environmental variable that was, that was set in the land of function using plume, create a metric name. In this case, outside temp, assign it a random variable and then do an H TB post to the right end point. Um And you know, M three, it's, you know, it's, you can uh connect to Prometheus. So you can use it as a back end prometheus. You can use it in, in place of MLU DB and sort of telegraphic collecting metrics. So there's really a lot of options for using M three. But again, it's that simple to write to it. And then if we go to, let's see if we go to Aws. Sure enough. Um We can see the serverless function that was created. And again, I can see you go, let me look at the code here and by those in this font size might be a little too small. Yeah. So I said, so here, here's the code again, same thing is just doing the H TB post. Um I can go over to, you know, the monitor tab and I can see see if we go to the error account success rate. I can see that. Yes, it is that in fact being fired off successfully. Um And then finally, so let's say I wanna do one other thing. Again, let's say that I decided, you know what? Actually think that I actually think that this uh that this eight gigs of ram and 100 and 50 gigabytes of storage isn't enough. Um Again, so I want to scale up to something that's a little bit beefier, a three note high avail base set with more storage and more ram. Again, it's really easy to hit the upgrade button. And in this case, I'm demoing it using the console, but you could just as easily do it via using the plume or the command line interface. And again, you can see that I'm spinning up three additional virtual machines of the new size and configuration that I specified. We're then gonna migrate the data over to those new, new nodes. And then finally, we're gonna decommission the current node, which is the green one once everything is online. So, but again, it really is, it's sort of that simple. Um So with that, I think I'm pretty much done with the demo. Um You know, Paul, do you have any thoughts or, or questions? Yeah. So there's a couple of really good things here. Uh Firstly, you showed that um in the stack output from Pulumi, you have the secret values. Um So it, it's, it's really important for me to say here. Uh Pulumi when you create a stack. So I'll take a step back. Pulumi has this idea of projects and stacks. OK. Project is the code. Um It's actually the, the resources and the layout and everything that's there. And uh a stack is a representation of the state plus the configuration. So a stack can be an environment. So it can be a DEV stack, a broad stack or whatever stack. Uh It can be developer, it can be an individual. Uh I've seen people even using it as tenants um and all sorts. And uh when you create a stack and Pulumi by default, whether you like it or not, Pulumi will create a secrets provider uh for you, the S provider if you do not specify one will be uh based on Pulumi K MS if you're using the Pulumi A uh or it will be um a passphrase back end if you're using anything that's not Pulumi Sa by default, but you can plug in your own K MS ID, uh your own key, vault id or your own GCP K MS ID or even you can use has vault in order to do it. So we try and because we know that, that uh people are using infrastructure like Ivan, which has sensitive passwords and it has uh sensitive connection strings that's there, we will actually decrypt them by default. And that value that you can see in the output isn't just in the output. Uh Trevor if you could run the command Pulumi stack export uh without show secrets. No show secrets on the end, please. Export. Yes, please. Um You'll actually see in the state if you scroll up a little bit, uh you'll a little more, you'll actually see a service you're on and you'll see a cipher text. It's just on the bottom third of your screen right now. So we actually embed it as a secret value in your state file as well. So you actually have to opt in to decrypting, which is why Trevor used the command dash dash show secrets, which instructs the Pulumi engine to actually decrypt it as part of the output. And uh we, we're trying to make sure that these sensitive values that you create by default are not exposed in case you check in the state file or the state file is compromised in any way, shape or form. So they the two tools kind of work really nicely together to create this this secure environment. And you could see exactly how I even handle that in their console because they start start start star and you have to opt in to show in the password as well. Yeah. And so, and like I said, so and everything else you can see right here. So if you wanted to see um you know the plan size that I'm using, if you want to see the project S a demo. So in this case, it's the same as S A demo. All that, all that non secret stuff is really easy to sort of see and leverage. But yeah, you're, you're provided with this extra safety layer for, you know, accidentally exposing credentials. Um And then likewise, just so I could see the sort of resources that have been provisioned. Um And the Ivans web-based console, I could also hop over to the Plummy web based console. I could see for the stack like this, my M three stack, I can go in here and I can also see some of the de the state details here and I can also go to activity and I can see what's happened in recently and whether it's sort of been successfully deployed or failed um or resource have been added or removed or, or things have been changed. So again, it's really easy to see all this stuff when you have sort of a lot of different options for how to consume this information. Um Yeah. And if I wanted to tear down all the stuff, it's as simple as doing just a pointy destroy command. I have a question about I if that's OK. Uh I, I seen that you showed how simple it was in order to scale your database in size. Does I even have uh an ability, ability to auto scale or do you know of best practices that people use to auto scale? Um The, the databases that they have in place Yeah. So we don't, so we don't uh provide sort of automagical auto scaling and that's because we don't want people to sort of have surprise bills. Um So again, not so it's not only just sort of a developer, ease of use, but also sort of developers sort of don't get fired kind of thing because you know your bills insane. So what we do in that regard is because everything you can, you can do using Pulumi or an API, you would simply monitor the resource utilization of that instance. So things like disk CP ram you would then again, you have options for tools, whether it's or Elk or someone you'd monitor that and then send, send a command to us and say, hey, scale this thing up and this is the new plan that I want to pick based on my forecast and us and then that scaling will happen in the background. I wonder if it would, I think it would be quite cool to build an integration with LAMBDA or something that based on Cloudwatch metrics that actually fires a request to look because you have an API you have an SDK and uh you would actually be able to potentially get some auto scale. But as you say, you know, you gotta be careful because you could run up a very big bill based on some errant metrics. Yeah, we have, we work with a lot of retailers. Um and so the retailers say, hey, we know like, um you know, Black Friday is coming up or Cyber Monday come is coming up and we know the traffic to our website could sort of 10 X. Uh We'll work with them as part of their sort of service team to and support team to make sure that we sort of provision the extra resources ahead of time. That way they're there, you know, they can service requests, but we still can sort of minimize the overall cost spent, you know, with that. And uh how if to get started with I today, what would you expect me to, to do, how, what resources are available that I can go and start playing with it without knowing a lot about it. So I would, I would recommend just signing up for an account. Uh When you sign in, sign up for an account, you'll get $300 worth of credits uh that you can sort of try to spin up services with, we'd have a sort of robust docs page much like Plumy has a great doc site. Um And we also have an API that's documented. So for instance, if we went to uh API dot I and IO forward slash doc, you can see really easy, uh let's say, OK, I want to, yeah, I want to create a mysql instance um Or I wanna fetch this core statistics of my current MSL instance. I can see the end point. I can see sort of code snippets in various languages, um curl. So it's really easy to get up and running and this is also a good resource to go to. So if you're not familiar or you want to learn more about what are the different options that I could configure for my, put my SQL instance, it's really easy to sort of look through these, all the options here. Awesome. Awesome. So I've just posted the link into the chat, uh which is the Get Started guide uh for Pulumi and Ivan. So the configuration required and a basic example to get people up and running. Um We're always willing to take uh feedback based on uh the experience around this, uh especially, you know, people who are, are using it uh off the beaten track of Pulumi, you know, when it comes to things like databases and, and this type of uh platform as a service. Uh We're very, very much interested in feedback and any bugs that you find. But, um, yeah, so take it for a test spin and I guess we can open it for questions if anybody has any quiet, quiet group today. So I'm gonna post uh my mail address. Oh Engine said, uh they already use Ivan and Pulumi. That's awesome. Very good to see people um who are here uh based on that. Um I'm going to post my mail address uh Paul at Pulumi dot com. And uh if you have any questions around Pulumi or getting started with Ivan today. Uh Then I'm more than happy to jump on a call and help you out. Otherwise I guess we can say thank you so much and we can give people back a little extra time. Awesome, Trevor. Thank you so much for joining us today. Um It's uh very interesting. They, they get a tour of Ivan and the autos scale and uh capabilities. I really didn't understand that Ivan actually handled uh multi cloud replicas and actually multi cloud uh transfers uh under the hood. So I'm very excited to take that for a little test drive for some of my own projects. Yeah. No, it was a pleasure. Pleasure chatting with everyone today and like I said, I look forward to kind of con continue the conversation with you, Paul. Um Like I said, just for me, I like, I like just being hands on and, and just doing things. So I, you know, just, just sign up and, and hammer away. It's you, you can't really get into that, that much trouble. Awesome. I will hold you to that. Awesome. Thank you so much, everyone. Uh take care and I hope to see you on another webinar against it. Yep. All right. Thanks everyone. Bye.
