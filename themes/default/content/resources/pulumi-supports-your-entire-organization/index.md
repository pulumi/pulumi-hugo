    Hi, my name is Joe Duffy and I'm the founder and CEO of Pulumi. I'm here today to give you an overview of Pulumi, the cloud engineering platform. Plume's cloud engineering platform helps organizations ship faster with confidence. We found Pulumi five years ago to reimagine the software development life cycle in a cloud native world. We learned from talking to practitioners that the modern cloud is complex. Also hearing from leaders that cloud transformation is taking too long and that even when successful, the promise of the cloud is not fully realized, Pulumi helps everybody in the organization. Developers can easily embrace cloud native architectures. Infrastructure experts contain modern cloud complexity and security engineers can ensure that cloud projects follow policies and best practices. The end result is that leaders can safely and securely accelerate their journey to the cloud by empowering the best and brightest talent in their organizations. Thousands of companies from early stage startups to fortune 500 enterprises have adopted Pulumi for the most mission critical cloud needs. Let's take a tour of Pulumi cloud engineering platform using Pulumi flagship infrastructures code, technology engineers build, deploy and manage cloud apps and infrastructure across many clouds such as Aws, Microsoft, Azure, VM Ware and Google Cloud along with more than 80 others. Plumy also supports the clouding of ecosystem including Cober and He Plumy taps into the industry's best languages too, including Python, no, Js and dot net. Unlocking access to great tools and best practices. This enables engineers to be productive and focus on architectures over building blocks. This approach is unique to Pulumi legacy infrastructures, code tools use proprietary DS LS that lock you in lead to copy and paste and harm productivity and security. Pulumi enterprise enables reliable and secure collaboration across the organization. It tracks who deployed what and when makes it easy to start small and scale up to thousands of environments and includes key identity policy and management features. Pulumi delivers one standard workflow across many clouds, public private and hybrid so that you can standardize in software development, delivery and security no matter which cloud you're using, reducing lock in and giving you flexibility and agility. Pluming enterprise is available as a highly available. So two type two SAS and including to a self host that can run anywhere including on prem behind a firewall. Many enterprises are adopting Pulumi and cloud engineering, Mercedes Benz Snowflake and Atlassian, for example, each accelerated their cloud innovation thanks to Pulumi, citing significant increases to productivity. The top three reasons you might choose Pulumi are to one accelerate your adoption of cloud native and multi cloud two, improve team collaboration and productivity by 50% or more with an internal cloud platform or three, fully leverage the cloud as a competitive advantage that transforms your business.
