    description: |
        In the mid-20th century, predicting the weather was still one part science, one part intuition, and one part luck. But as computers, data collection, and modeling have steadily improved, we now produce staggeringly accurate weather short-term forecasts.

        In tech, we're still early in our journey to more deeply understanding and modeling our world through learning from incidents. As we improve, what if we could start forecasting incidents?

        In this presentation, we'll talk about Risk Radar, Netflix's forum to collect and make sense of emergent sociotechnical risk both from experienced-incidents, and risk which can predict angry, incident-filled skies.
