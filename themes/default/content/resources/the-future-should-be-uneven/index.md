        "The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed" is something we say about why people on instant connection devices walk past people sleeping on sidewalks.

        We don't want a homogenous web, we want an accessible, personalized web. What I want and need is different than everyone else. And although the Dominos ruling mandates that everyone make their sites accessible, it's a non-trivial problem because different kinds of accessibility solutions can conflict with others.

        Let's talk about how we can provide more power to users to customize, configure, streamline, and understand what they are getting from us. Let's explore some accessibility settings that turn out to be just good universal design.

        You're going to leave this talk inspired to build an infrastructure that can support the glorious diversity of the future, instead of assuming that everyone is the same.
