  description: |
    Pulumi Insights has arrived and brings an enormous productivity enhancement to infrastructure as code. Born from partnering with our community and customers, Pulumi Insights provides intelligence, search, and analytics over any infrastructure in any cloud across your organization, leveraging the latest advances in generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).   Discover the power of Pulumi Insights in this video overview and in detail at https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-insights  If needed, use Pulumi Cloud Import to apply Search and Insights to resources created outside of Pulumi, e.g., in Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM, or Kubernetes YAML.

    Pulumi Insights is intelligence for infrastructure as code. It adds advanced search analytics and A I to infrastructure as code with insights. You can gain unique insights into the organization's cloud usage and trends and boots engineering productivity insights as three pillars of functionality. The first pillar is search. You can find anything in any cloud. You can ask any questions about your infrastructure across more than 100 clouds using either structured search queries or natural language prompts. Search helps you find that needle in a haystack locating a single resource across many clouds and environments. The next pillar is analytics. You can gain deeper insights into cloud infrastructure. You could have rest api that can be used to programmatically query and add automation around search results or to integrate with internal platforms and dashboards. You can export data to other data warehouses including Snowflake, Amazon, Redshift, Google, Bigquery and Azure Synapse. You also have built in dashboards that give you key insights about cloud usage. These analytics capabilities can be used to identify anomalies or trends in resource usage and dig into cost security and compliance concerns. The last pillar is A I Pulumi insights embeds new A I capabilities throughout the Pulumi platform, Pulumi deeply understands usage patterns and can deliver recommendations or even generate infrastructures code automatically. You can now use a new campaign website to author infrastructures code programs using large language models. You can also use a new co I to author the Pulumi program as well as modify the infrastructure. Pulumi insights now provides unrivaled intelligence into cloud resources. So you can gain unique insights about usage and trends and boost engineering productivity. Go try it out today.
