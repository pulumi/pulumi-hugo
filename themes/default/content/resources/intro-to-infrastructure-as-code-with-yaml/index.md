  title: Intro to Infrastructure as Code with YAML
  description: >-
    In this workshop, we’re going to learn more about cloud computing
    and Infrastructure as Code by exploring how to use Pulumi to build,
    configure, and deploy a real-life, modern application using Docker. We will
    create a frontend, a backend, and a database to deploy the Pulumipus Boba
    Tea Shop, and along the way, learn more about how Pulumi works to make
    managing all of these different moving pieces a little bit less painful!


    If you want to code along, you’ll need a [free Pulumi SaaS account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/) and [the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).
