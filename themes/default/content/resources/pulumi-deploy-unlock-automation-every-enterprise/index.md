    Hello, I'm Evan, a cloud engineer here at Pulumi and I'm really excited to share some new developments in cloud infrastructure today. We're launching Pulumi deployments a huge advancement in infrastructure automation that can enable you to manage 10 times as many cloud resources as a traditional operations team at Pulumi tools are in our DNA. We believe that every operator and developer deserves tools that can tame the complexity of the cloud is your organization finding that infrastructure can only scale with headcount. You can't hire fast enough to meet that demand, products are delayed and that your team is feeling burned out under ever increasing load. Well, what if there was a better way a product allowed you to scale infrastructure with software, harness the power of the cloud to accelerate your business and give your engineers and operators superpowers. In 2020 Pulumi launched automation API. The industry's first infrastructure is code orchestration framework and it immediately took off as we've seen millions of automated cloud updates since leading SAS and cloud infrastructure companies like Snowflake and Mercedes Benz use automation API to accelerate their businesses every day and the data doesn't lie in the last two years. Our internal usage data has shown that organizations that bet on automation api can manage 10 times as much infrastructure per engineer as opposed to traditional tools. But how do you make your organization 10 times more productive? You might ask, that's why today we're launching Pulumi deployments. We've taken the lessons we've learned from working with our leading automation api adopters and products. It into turn key solutions ready to accelerate your enterprise that includes quick to deploy the ability to push a button and easily create update, refresh and destroy infrastructure from within the Pulumi console. Get pushed to deploy a deeply integrated get apps workflow that allows you to get pushed to update infrastructure, including pr previews and checks deeply integrated into github. The deployments rest API a building block that can power your cloud platform and remote deployment support for automation. API using the same automation API you love backed by Pulumi hosted deployment service. But enough talking, let's see some demos. First, let's start with the Pulumi C. Let's run this program. We've written some typescript to deploy an AWS three bucket, but you can use hundreds of cloud providers in any of the most popular programming languages including Python go, Java C# typescript and YAML. Now let's configure the stack to connect to Pulumi deployments. First we navigate to settings, then deploy first we select the repository and then the branch and many other information that we might need to connect this repository now we can click to deploy our stack. Let's run a refresh. Great. That deployment is now running can click into the deployment and see all the set up logs and configuration in one centralized location. But we can also use a git driven workflow including pull requests. Let's open a pr to merge our S3 stack. When we open the Pr Pulumi deployments automatically runs a preview to visualize the proposed changes. The preview result gets posted back to the pull request after we reviewed our code and the preview, we merge our pull request. This automatically triggers an update via Pulumi. Deploy every piece of infrastructure within your organization can rely on automatic cloud delivery with push deploy and click to deploy your cloud engineering team has a turn key in for workflow, ready to go on day one without writing a single line of code. Every environment, every commit always up to date. All of this is built on top of the plume deployments, rest API a building block you can use to create your own custom infrastructure platforms just as we can click to deploy, we can curl to deploy the update starts running right away and the response even contains a link to the live update. So anyone in your organization can observe its progress. Let's take a look at some of the tools you can build with the Pulumi deployments. Rest API here, we've built a platform for temporary infrastructure using Pulumi webhooks, LAMBDA. And the deployments rest api let's tail the logs using Pulumi logs to see what's going on. When we add a TTL tag to our stack with a time span and run an update. It schedules the cloud resources for clean up. After exploration, the update is running and the stack has been queued for deletion after the expiration period. Infrastructure waste is a common problem. It's too easy to leave development, infrastructure running accidentally and end up with a huge bill. Many companies have entire teams devoted to solving this problem. And there we go. The TTL lambda has kicked off a deployment that will clean up this stack and stop our AWS spend just as we can click to destroy, we can build automated destroy and we can do the same thing for refreshing resources and keeping infrastructure up to date. In our next example, we've used the deployment stress api inside of a scheduled lander to build drift detection. Let's deploy the drift detector, manual edits from within the AWS console can wreak havoc on your infrastructure if those changes aren't brought back into source control. The last thing you want is to scale out a service just to have the next C run undo that change. You can build drift detection into your platform and get automated alerts on unexpected infrastructure changes. There we are, the automated refresh has been scheduled with the expect no changes flagged so we'll be notified with a failure if any changes are detected so that we can take action. These are just a few of the platform capabilities that you can build on top of Pulumi deployments to help scale your infrastructure with software. But that's not all. Finally, for all you platform builders that are already using automation. API we've added support for remote execution via Pulumi deployments. You can change just a few lines of code to run your programs in a remote workspace. Let's run this one. Our automation program runs locally but offloads running updates onto the Pulumi service. We get logs streamed from the deployment's rest api directly to standard out. Now, you can run thousands of updates concurrently without having to manage the compute. This makes multi region infrastructure build outs a breeze all with the greater reliability, scalability and observ ability of the Pulumi deployments platform. We've walked through click to deploy and get pushed to deploy two turn key workflows that are already out of the box to accelerate your delivery to the cloud. In addition, we've seen the Plumy deployments, rest API and remote execution and automation api these tools simplify building a custom cloud platform in your organization with gloomy deployments. We've given you the tools to be 10 times as productive, managing the cloud build on a platform that gives you increased scalability, operability and observ ability with a fraction of the code required to get off the ground. Happy building
