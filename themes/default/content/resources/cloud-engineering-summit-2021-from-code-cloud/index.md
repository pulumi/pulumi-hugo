  description: |
    As the need for well-designed cloud infrastructure increases, front end developers and early career developers may be feeling the pressure to learn CloudOps and DevOps practices. Commonly, software developers are on time crunch and don't always have extra time to study more. The good news is if you may already have the necessary skills! In this workshop, I'll discuss how I leveraged GitHub to make my code CloudOps ready without learning new tools or collecting new certifications.  Talk by: Rizel Scarlett

    Hi, everyone. I hope you're having an amazing time at Pulumi Cloud Engineering Summit. I know that I am. Uh I want to take this time to personally thank the team at Pulumi for giving me the space to talk about my learnings, my experiences and code. So let's jump straight into it. Uh My talk is entitled Code Two Cloud. I'm kind of just gonna give an overview of how I got my code to be hosted on the cloud with very little cloud engineering experience and how you can do that too. So I'll start with a quick story of a time that I worked at a company that did releases at night. Um And there was a reason we did this, we did them like Friday night at nine or like Saturday night between like 89 starting. Um These could end at up to like midnight depending on how many, how, how well things were, how smoothly things went. And the reason we did this is because we didn't have a great C I CD pipeline in place. So um it was all hands on deck to make sure that nothing broke um before during or after the release, uh, I found this extremely nerve-racking one. I wanted to, like, hang out on my weekend nights. I'm young so I wanted to have fun and then to, uh, I just don't trust myself to find every single bug and to know what's broken because I'm human. Um, so most of the time, majority of the time I would come in on Monday and things would be on fire. So that, that was, that was to be expected because like I said, we're human. So we couldn't pick out and predict every single error on the flip side after I worked at that company, I worked at another startup. Um But they use github actions to automate their release workflow. I was actually very impressed. I had never like encountered or used github actions before that. And I was like, oh my gosh, so cool, like uh the release takes like 5 to 10 minutes so we can do it during the day. Um And if anything goes wrong, you can easily revert it. I was very impressed. Um And I think both of those experiences um were valuable for me because they allowed me to see how important it is to have some kind of strong DEV ops or cloud ops structure in your project and to at the very least implement AC I CD pipeline. Um And I made it a goal to have AC I CD pipeline for my personal projects and my freelance projects. Um just to get better practice and to get in the habit of doing that. So this talk, as you can probably tell is gonna be for front-end developers, early career developers, open source maintainers or contributors who are like, hm maybe I should implement some kind of C I CD pipeline. Um or anyone who doesn't do cloud engineering for their day to day work. I know this is a cloud engineering summit. So a lot of y'all are cloud engineers. Uh I'd advise you to still stick around because I want feedback. I want to know how I could have done things better or um more easily. I'm sure I, I made things hard for myself. I also think it'll be cool for you to see um from this perspective of someone who is a little bit more fun and heavy. So before I dive into that, you have no clue who I am, right? So my name is Roselle. I am a junior developer advocate at github and I was trained as a full stack software engineer. Um Three years ago, I've, I've moved around the stack, but I've mostly been heavy in on the front end and I'm also a program director at G Code House, which is a nonprofit organization aimed at training women of color and people of color uh to code. And as you can see, I'm very passionate about empowering and educating others, especially within the tech industry. I'm passionate about my own learning journey and I am addicted to Twitter. So because I'm addicted to Twitter, I would definitely tell you to follow me on there. I'll follow back, I'll interact with you. Uh My handle is black girl bites. That's my handle on Twitter. Hash. No get Dev 0.2. I will soon to be on tiktok and youtube. So if you want some awkward black girl content about code, definitely look out for me there. So like I said, because this talk is for people who don't have that much cloud engineering experience or DEV ops experience. Um You've heard me throwing around the words or the term C I CD pipeline. Maybe you're wondering what does it mean and why does it matter? C I CD stands for continuous integration and the CD um part of it can stand for continuous delivery or continuous deployment, I think it is all about and it matters for like these five reasons. So essentially it allows you or through C I CD pipeline, you're creating automated test code builds. Um You're encouraging your team to make small incremental changes and check them in frequently. Um Because nobody, he likes that person who is checking in like a long pr like 90 files change. Now you're affecting the whole team. Now they have to all rebase off of you and get um sidetracked from their actual task. It's also automating the delivery of these applications to production, to staging, to DEV and whatever other environments you have. Um It's also just enabling teams to catch bugs more easily and more frequently. Um because you have these automated processes in place and therefore improving the code quality overall and improving the team morale. Because now they have a reduced workload, they can focus on collaboration, having fun and coding. So of course, with these talks, someone tells you about a new tool or something you should be using. And you're like, yeah, this is cool, but now I have to learn something new and I don't have time to learn something new. I, I feel that pain, I feel that pain. That's why I built my application with the intention that I am going to use familiar tools to put to host my project on the cloud and to implement AC IC pipeline. So I'm gonna kind of show you guys my application very quickly. I built a get Emoji search app with njs Tailwind, CS S and Fuse Js. I've never used these technologies before, but they were very familiar to me because I'm like familiar with React and I'm familiar with CS S. Let me show you the app very quickly. So here's my app um posted locally. I'm calling it cute emoji. Uh It's nothing crazy, very simple interface so far. Um I'm sure it'll grow. Um It shows the first couple of emojis and this is, this is calling G hubs, Api, emoji API. Um And essentially I can do a search for whatever I'm looking for. So let's say I'm looking for yellow. Um It shows me like a yellow circle, yellow heart, yellow square, let's say if I search the word girl um shows me a bunch of girls if I misspell something. Um Oh what can I misspell maybe moo um or start to spell something. We got Moon cake boo book. So as you can see this is the start of my application and it is using fuzzy search. I kind of want to show you guys how I'm using fuzzy search um because I thought it was cool. So I was able to do fuzzy searching within my app using Fuse Js, which is an open source project. Uh I thought this was a great lifesaver because I was considering writing my own algorithm for this, which would have been a lot of work or um using a different tool that I would eventually have to start paying for as my project grew. Um So I didn't really want to do all of that. I was able to implement this with like very little lines of code. So let's look at it over here. Um As you can see, I have an options object and I'm passing in a keys property and in this keys property, I essentially am passing in all the um I guess property names of that object that I passed in or the data that I'm passing in and I'm saying, like I want my user to search by emoji name. Um And that includes scores line is essentially saying like return the results that are most relevant. So it scores it in some way saying like, oh, this is like most relevant to the least relevant. I don't want to see the least relevant, hide those or don't show those first. Um Then I pass in, I create a new fuse objects instance and I pass in the API data and this options object that I just created. Um And then I call a method called fuse dot search. Um And depending on whatever query that the user typed into the input bar, it'll call that search method on it and return the results. It was so easy. Like what is this like just a few lines of code? Um And I was able to do fuzzy searching, OK, back to cloud and C I CD stuff. Like I said, my goal was to implement C I CD pipeline and to get it hosted on the cloud. Um Very simple stuff. I just want to do this as a teaching tool for myself and I expect my app to grow beyond what it is right now. This is, this is to me, very simple or very simple for me. So um I wanted to be have it be able to scale and to be maintainable. So I also said I'm not trying to learn anything new. I'm trying to focus on using familiar tools and languages and platforms. So I decided to go for github actions um because I've been on github for like ever since I learned to code. So I'm very familiar with it and github actions has open source automated work flows. I was thinking maybe I don't have to start from scratch. Plus actions are very well documented. Also, I went to go, I decided to go with Pulumi to deploy my code to the cloud. One of the benefits of Pulumi is I don't have to like learn how to use Aws or Google cloud provider or whatever you may have. I just have to write in my favorite coding language or the coding language. I'm most familiar with which is javascript. Um So I started off by creating an S3 bucket and here's like my little Pulumi javascript that I wrote to create a new S3 bucket. Um And I told it to point to um the index html file and, and a 404 html file to say like this is the index of the, the index document of the website. And then this is the error page. Um And then I ran Pulumi up. That's kind of how you um deploy your changes. I was like, wow, this is so easy. I'm having fun. Uh The only little problem I had is that I realized, wow, this is the next Js project and I don't have an index dot html file. So, um when I did plu me up and I went to go check if it got loaded to the S3 bucket, I saw an error. Um and I realized the error was pretty easy to fix. I was able to generate both an index dot html file and a 404 dot HTM filed by running next build and next export. Um I added this as a script to my package dot JSON. That way, I'll just have to run N PM, run export. And as you can see it created an out folder with all of these files in it. So it generated a website URL for me. Um I could have given it a more uh specific name and I probably will, but this was my first attempt. So I just went with S3 website bucket. Uh Let's check it out. So now we are on that um URL that says S3 website bucket, bunch of random numbers. Um And we're seeing the same thing that we saw that I had locally. You type in words, you got, you're getting emojis. So everything's working, everything's good over here. So essentially I got it on the cloud, it's on AWS uh check to that one goal that I had. Um Then my next goal was trying to lay the foundations um for starting up like AC IC the pipeline. I do wanna warn y'all. This isn't like the whole thing. It's not the whole shebang it's just like a very simple start and I realized POY has her action. So I don't really have to write my own. I was very excited about that. So here's how I initially set everything up to um be able to use Pulumi github actions. First, I enabled my application to talk with each other. So I wanted Pulumi github action to be able to talk to github. Um and that required some authentication. So Pulumi um needed the github action needed to like call my Aws access key Aws region and all that instead of like saving that in my repo um for other people to access. I used github secrets and now it's encrypted, no one knows, but my applications can speak to each other. I also installed the Pulumi application. Um This was a little tool that they made um to allow um the github action to actually leave comments on my PR S or whatever event that I used um for github actions. And then I just copied Pulumi github action code, um their, their Yaml and I modified it to work for me. So first they, they had two yu actions that I found. The first one allowed me to see the activity that happened in my Pulumi stack. So if I like made any changes in that stack, it would um like print out like, hey, these are the three things changed or like a small error happened. This way I would gain like a little visibility into why something happened rather than like going into the Pulumi console. Um We can take a really quick look at like what the action looked like. Essentially this is the name of that action. We're saying we want this to happen on pull request. Um We're doing like a couple of things that you need to do for github actions which is like just checking out the code um and setting up node um configuring my my AWS credentials for it. And then um I think right here uses Pulumi slash action dot V three is where we're using Pulumi github action. And um it does all the magic behind the scenes. So um on each of my pull requests, now I get a little comment, I'm not actually doing this, this is automated. Um And the comment essentially shows what things changed for this specific pr nothing changed. There was two un unchanged resources um for my Pulumi stack and I thought that was cool. Alright. So the other Pulumi action or github action that I implemented showed me a live preview of my website, which is something I wanted. Um I don't really have test on my application as yet, but I wanted that every time I do apr I can get a quick live preview before I merge it into production because I've had many times in my life where something is working locally for me. It's working on my machine. I'm like, wow, everything's all good and then I merge it to uh production or whatever like the main branch is. Um And I realize it doesn't work at all and I have no clue why. So I decided life preview might be a really great and easy way for me to do some manual testing. OK. So let's have a look at my repo. Um I am in the pull request and I opened up apr of me just changing the background gradient. If you could remember, I had like pink and then it like went over to like a little bit of a bluish color. So let us see. Basically again here we have the first like automated pr or sorry, automated comment from the github action and then we have the second one which gives me a live preview of the site. Um So let's click on it and see what it looks like. Cool there, we have it, we got um a blue to pink to green gra gradient, which is what this pr was all about. Let's have a look at the actual like code for the github action. I modified this a little bit just to, to fit my use case. Um But basically what they had worked for me. Um First I checked out the code um I essentially did N PM run export again because it was looking for index dot html file. And um I needed to generate that for the action. And then um I use this um update live preview um called Pulumi that Pulumi created. I passed it all my environment variables that it needs and all the magic happens. So I wanna make this disclaimer that I'm not done yet with, with the project I'm near near done with the talk. Um There's lots of stuff to do in terms of like implementing a strong C I CD pipeline. But I think this is definitely a good start for me to lay the foundations. Um And it really only took me about like an hour or two to do all this. Um So this is me saying like, go ahead, try it out, try out get hub actions, try out Pulumi. I hope this was interesting and edifying for y'all. Thank you for listening to me speak. Um And definitely check out my rio uh It's at get help dot com slash black girl pis slash get emojis, definitely download it, play around with it, suggest some things for it to, for me to make it cooler. Um because I am still thinking of like what I could do with it. Thank you.
