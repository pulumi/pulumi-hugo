    Well, hello, welcome back to the main stage. Uh Really happy to see you here. I wanna thank all of our amazing speakers and panelists today for great conversation around infrastructures code and cloud engineering. I definitely learned a lot. I hope you did as well and just wanted to quickly recap what we announced this morning. You know, Pulumi as the industry's first universal infrastructures code tool. Um We're really happy to bring Java on board and really support the entire Java ecosystem as part of you know, infrastructures code and building modern cloud applications, really excited about YAML as well. You know, I think having that simple interface infrastructures code with a clear path to scaling up as your needs get more complex over time is just a really powerful combination with all Pulumi existing great support for languages like typescript and Python and Go and Csar. Also a ton of great packages over 1000 new universal packages available in all languages across some of our new partners like Oracle cloud J Frog Garden, factory data bricks, also Pulumi Crosswalk now available in all languages on a par top feature requests. Uh you know, since we launched that, you know, a year and a half to two years ago and then also the ability to bring all of a WO CD K on top of Pulumi and to support it in a fully native way is just really a lot of uh richness and, and capabilities in the package ecosystem now so that you can move beyond building blocks to focusing on business value and entire architectures. Of course, all of this is made possible by cross code which gives us universal translation, the ability to share packages across languages and more to us. Universal is important. Universal is what really brings the cloud to all of us and enables organizations to shift faster with confidence, you know, supporting every cloud that's part of universal. Um whether that's public, private or hybrid, supporting every language, all of the major cloud languages are now supported by Pulumi including Yemen. Remember the LNML stands for language, every cloud builder from developers to infrastructure experts, to operators, to security engineers and everybody in between really excited that Pulumi has a universal appeal and ability to connect with practitioners of all backgrounds. Every architecture, you know, this is not just a serverless tool, it's not just a tool for containers, you know, really Pulumi universally supports all cloud architecture and that's, that's a real key as well because you know, most of our customers, especially if you're in a hybrid world, you're doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that. You're using servers for event driven architectures and containers for state, full workloads and manage services to offload heavily lift into the cloud. We want to support that entire spectrum and Pulumi supports that uh with its approach as well. And then finally, every cloud resource, you know, we know that you're probably coming from an existing solution, maybe manual provisioning, maybe scripting, maybe terraform, maybe cloud formation, but no matter where you're coming from, we've got a way to bring you on board to universal infrastructures code. Easily seen, incredible open source momentum, you know, over 2400 contributors. That's, that's a ton of folks contributing obviously way more users of the platform. But seeing the community contributing to the health and growth of the ecosystem is, is amazing. And you know, I wanna shout out to the community members who helped bring Java up. It actually started as a uh open source project and the same way that dot net did and we've got folks that are actively bringing up reps, you know, thanks to cross code being open source, you know, so this vibrancy is just kind of building on itself and it's, it's wonderful to see as part of that. I'm really happy today to announce the preliminaries program. The preliminary program is designed to recognize those folks in the community who are experts and leaders and who are really helping to build this vibrant, welcoming, inclusive community where we're all helping each other in whatever it is we're trying to do in the club. And the preliminary program is meant to recognize those already doing amazing work. And, you know, we've got a ton of, of uh great folks who are helping each other on a daily basis, you know, in our community Slack in github on social. And so I'm really excited today to announce the preliminaries and our founding team of preliminaries uh is, is here. So uh Paul Hicks, Kal Ali Joshua Stitt Simon Olson Reel, Scarlett, Ringo, Desmet, Kat Morgan. And, and all of these folks have great Twitter accounts. I I encourage you to follow, but you'll probably encounter them in the ploy community as well, whether you're in Community Slack or in github. And I just want to thank every one of these folks for all of the work they've done to create such an amazing ploy community, looking forward to working together in the months to come. So with that, um hope you have enjoyed the practitioner track the cloud leadership, track the main stage and, and the panels, all of it's on video. So if you didn't catch it live in real time, uh we'll be publishing links to that. So check it out afterwards. We've also got some activities tomorrow that you should uh check out as well. So we've got a workshop to, to go through some of the new features we, we ship today. So if you want some real hands on instructor led uh time. It's the best way to get up and running and really familiarize yourself um with what we've got to offer with Java. We've got our first ever community summit. This is the first of many, I'm really excited. Mandy Stratton is gonna lead this uh uh effort and, you know, take it, take inspiration from some of the other devops community um events that we've all got experience with, with open spaces, do a bit of a live stream, come hang out. It's a great way to interact with the community. Some of the Pulumi preliminaries will be there. A bunch of employees at Pulumi will be there as well. Hoping, hoping to see you there and then keep an eye out for some partner workshops that we'll be doing later in May and in June. So with just a wrap things up, I'd love to talk a little bit about what's next, you know, launching Universal Infrastructures Code was really a major moment for us and it's great to have Java and El and the Pulumi service provider and some of these higher level packages, but you know what's next. So I really think there are three key things that's top of mind for us. One universal infrastructures code, we really believe that's the best infrastructures code. And so we're gonna continue innovating there and making sure that Pulumi is the best infrastructures code platform in the industry. You can bet on it, you can use it for any scenario that you're looking to go into the cloud and you need infrastructure as code. Um And that's obviously open source community led community driven and that's primary focus. Number one for us, next is helping large teams adopt cloud engineering that scale, you know, going from just running infrastructures code to having a complete end to end solution that helps infrastructure teams partner with their developers and get security engineers comfortable and and helping to contribute there as well to us that's cloud engineering and that's really especially at enter enterprise scale, it goes beyond infrastructures code. We talked about some of those core capabilities as part of the platform, you know, policy is code, identity integration, you know, we have a lot more in store there. So keep an eye out for that. And then so that's sort of going deeper with larger organizations and the final area. The third area of focus really is just making it a whole lot easier to program the cloud for every cloud builder, not folks who, you know, of course, folks who are deep in infrastructure and understand cloud and uh you know, Pulumi is already, you know, great for those folks. We really want to make the cloud more accessible to more and more people. And you know, going from building blocks to architectures is one great example of that in action, but clearly we're not done. We're just getting started on this journey. And you know, we have a lot of ideas, a lot of projects in store for you, keep an eye out there. You know, everything we do obviously will be open source and community led. So we love to hear your thoughts but um a lot of exciting things in store there as well and add all this up. And I think infrastructure is code cloud engineering. You know, we're just getting started but tons of momentum, tons of excitement and just so happy to have you part of the community. Thank you for showing up today. Hope you enjoyed. Hope you learned some things and um remember, check out everything we shipped today. It's all open source and up online today. Thank you.
