    In this tutorial, Mike Metral shows you how to use Pulumi to setup Kubernetes on Amazon EKS using the TypeScript language and shows you how to deploy an application to the cluster.  While the tutorial uses TypeScript and AWS, Pulumi supports many popular programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Golang, and .NET and it works with all major cloud providers.

    Pulumi is a modern infrastructure as code tool that allows you to declarative, describe and manage your infrastructure using your favorite programming language. We support the programming languages, javascript, typescript, Python go and dot net. You can use these programming languages to provision any AWS resource or service that is offered because we have code, we can encapsulate this code to share best practices using package managers. So we can use N PM if we're using no languages and we can use PP if we're using Python because we have code, we can see the preview of the changes that will happen before they take place and get a full audit of who changed what and when we have built in secret management support to protect the secrets that your infrastructure uses along with the secrets that protect the state file for the stack itself in polluting because we have code, you can write unit tests and integration tests to validate and verify your infrastructure. And most importantly, our SDKS are completely open source. Here's an example of how to create an EC2 VM and a security group using the Python language can also be used to manage Cabernet's S code. In addition to cloud native services, that means you can use your favorite programming languages to describe your infrastructure to provision the A P resources in cnet's to reduce the amount of copy and pasting. You have to do and benefit from the same preview changes and audit histories that you get with deploying cloud native services. You can also deploy com charts inject side cars for envoy su and others because it's just code and we have many integration points with C I CD systems. Here's an example of how to create a deployment and service using the text language in 33 lines of code. Let's show a quick demo of how to deploy an AWS EKS cluster and an application into that cluster. We'll start off by installing the package dependencies we need for our program. Since we're using typescript to deploy our EPS cluster, I'm going to use M PM to install them once installed. We can initialize our Pulumi stack and set the configuration settings such as the region to deploy into. We'll open up our index its which is the entry point and import all of the STK libraries we just installed. We'll start off by creating a VPC with public and private subnets in all A Zs of the region. As you can see my ID is helping me because I have languages to work with, I will use a standard set of block notation and because it's code, I can jump into the documentation and get more information about the properties for the VPC. Next, I'll set the A to use all and then we'll say before we create the cluster, let's preview what these changes will look like. Everything looks good. So let's keep going. We'll create a new cluster for EKS, we'll define the VPC to use the private sum that's required. And we're going to define this with the Fargate profile so that nodes are managed by Fargate. The preview looks good. Next, we'll export the cluster's coupon fig which is just the property on the cluster. Once set, let's preview the changes and run a deployment. It all checks out. So let's say yes. Once the deployment is complete, we'll examine the stack's output in the stack output. We've put the Q config for the cluster that allows us to extract that variable from the stack and use it with tools like Q control to get the information of the nodes and the pods running in the cluster. Great. Everything's running. Let's expand the demo by deploying a new pod. We'll start off by creating a provider which is a wrapper for the coupon fig that allows us to interchange the cluster use independent of the resource being deployed. We'll start off by creating a new pod with a sidecar in this pod. We'll give it a name and tell it to use the provider for that coupon fig. If you've worked with communities, this spec should look identical since we use the same API that you're used to working with in communities, we simply take the open API spec from cities and expose it as SDKS in the language of your choice. We'll define the volume amounts for this engineer container. Since we're gonna have two containers in this pod, we'll define the second container which is a Debian container that will write to that shared pod. And once that's complete, we'll preview and update the changes to see if the pot can be deployed. Once the pod is ready, we can examine it by using cube control, we can check out his logs as well as the demo showed, we can deploy cloud native infrastructure and communities apr resources through Pulumi using real programming languages. This allows you to cut down the boiler plate and create your own distractions or leverage ones that we've created for you and allow you to create reusable components that you can share. An example of that is our AWS X package, which is denoted on top that allows you to describe a Fargate service with a load balancer. You can use the ID E for linking compilers for checking and policy packs to find issues before deployment. And we even have an integration testing framework that allows you to test your Pulumi program stacks using the go programming language. You can get started today by visiting Pulumi dot com. Thank you.
