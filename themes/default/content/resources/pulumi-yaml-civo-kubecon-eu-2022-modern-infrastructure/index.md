    Hello, my name is David Flanagan. I'm a developer advocate at Pulumi and I'm joined today at Coupon live with Kay, a developer advocate for civil cloud. Kai is going to share a little bit about what we are doing today at coupon. It's pretty cool. Let's hear from him. Thanks David. Um Yeah, my name is Kai. I'm a developer advocate at CO and we are the cloud native service provider. So what we do is uh Kubernetes that is developer focused and 100% ktis all the way all the turtles down, right? So um we are at Keep Con and we've actually brought a mini region with us. So we have this Bonkers idea of what if we had an edge region. So we have our own data centers all around the world. But what if we had one here right at the event and we plugged it in and it's um I believe you're going to show it, you know, to all the viewers, but basically you can launch a clock in about 90 seconds and it runs on hardware. That's our booth at our booth and you can come see the blinking lights of where your cluster is actually running. So, you know, we thought it would be fun to kind of bring the hardware to a software convention, you know, and kind of see this is where your actual like, you know, kubernetes runs. And uh since we sort of we run the, the our own cloud, so we just brought some of that with us. So just to clarify people right now, can go to CV dot com, deploy a K CS cluster and it will be running right here on that thing. That is a real production region. It is a production region. The only difference is that it's a little bit smaller than, than our sort of other big data center region. So it's a, it's like a small part of, of one rack, you know, instead of multiple racks. But yeah, it's, it's a fully, it's exactly the same hardware. So we run open compute hardware. So it's the same stuff that is in our data centers. And then yeah, it runs the same C platform. So if you're using Pulumi, you can deploy a cluster as long as you point it to the cube con region. So if you have a cluster that's already running in one of our other regions, and you want to replicate that you would literally just change the, the region ID and hit a plume up and you'd be up and running. It's just such an awesome idea that's got a real tangible feel to it that people can really do this. Have people been sharing with you what they're deploying on the clusters are doing here? And has there been anything that's pretty cool that you wouldn't have thought you'd see before? So one thing, so we have a competition during coupon. So if you deploy a sort of sample app that we have in our app marketplace on a coupon region cluster, it automatically notify you that, hey, by the way, we have a code for you to enter a raffle. So that's obviously a cool thing that you can do and you can do that remotely as well as long as you're sort of in the coupon region, you don't actually have to physically be on site, it will still be on there. The other thing that I thought was quite cool is some of the other exhibitors here just went like, oh cool. So I could do my demo on this and I could tell them to that. It's running sort of three booths down and we were like, yeah, yeah, you could do that. So there are, I know for a fact that there are demos running in this hall that are running on this machine right here, right? That's very cool. Now, we're gonna take a look at deploying something to SVO cloud with Pulumi. All right. So I am going to walk and talk Kai through spinning up a case customer on CV with their amazing coupon region. We're gonna start by running Pulumi. This is gonna give us a list of templates that we can choose from. And we're gonna go to show additional templates from here. You can filter by type and SIU and we'll get a list of supported templates. And today we're going to use, we need to provide a project name and a stack name. So good choice it returned and let's just call this. My access token is on the buffer. You can command view that. I promise it's OK. All right. Let's pop this open A VS code. Oh right. Yeah. And we have two files. The first one is our stack config which is Pulumi coupon dot yaml, which has our encrypted token. So don't think of it stealing it. And we have our Pulumi dot Yamma, which is our main entry point into this. So you can see that we have the name of the project. It's the run time of YAML and that standard description that we just let go. And then we have a list of resources. We have a firewall. We have a KTIS cluster. We don't really need to do anything else except for change or region. So I'll let you handle that and this is the name of our special rack region that is running for the direction of cub and we imaginatively just called it coupon. Are you going to move it to your house after this? It's going to go to a couple of other events and we're actually going to create a passport and do postcards of all the places that it's been. I think we have to make region happen. Like I mean, I need to probably run three phase power to my house but, but yeah, we could do it. Ok. So the next thing we need to do is run Pulumi preview. This will give us a plan of what Pulumi is going to create on our C cluster. If we're happy with that, we can ramp up and let it do its magic. There we go in just 90 seconds. A Pulumi orchestrated Cooper cluster on seal cloud. OK. Anything you want to add just that I love the fact that you can now template with Yale. But the other thing is that we've got a couple of other features that are coming soon which you will probably be able to um template with, with Pulumi as soon as they're out in the form of managed databases and, or databases as a service and object storage. So stay tuned for those. All right. We'll see you all next time.
