        With AWS Cloud Control API, AWS introduced standardized APIs with the goal of solving support for the latest AWS innovation through a resource-oriented model, typically available on the day of launch. In this session, we will introduce how we took Cloud Control API from concept to launch, the culture and technical changes instituted internally to launch Cloud Control API, and the importance of engaging with partners and customers early in defining the product, user experience, and development.
