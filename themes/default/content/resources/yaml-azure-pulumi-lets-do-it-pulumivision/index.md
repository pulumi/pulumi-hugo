    I am here for some Pulumi vision. We are going to be uh focusing on Pulumi Yael. Um I'm also doing a workshop tomorrow if you want to know more about Pulumi Yael a little more formal way. But uh today we're just gonna kind of play around and see what we can find. Uh So YAML is a new uh language that's supported in Pulumi. Well, it's the, the animal is not new but it's new to Pulumi. And you might kind of wonder why we might want to do that because it doesn't have a lot of the constructs and things that some of the other programming languages that we do in Pulumi might have like conditionals and loops, but it's a really great entry point to get started with Pulumi and uh can be used to really kind of create some building blocks of things. So gonna kind of do some just very initial, I will be honest, I have not played with this at all. This is my first time touching any Pulumi El. So we're gonna see how it goes. We're gonna start with kind of a more basic setup. We're just gonna go through the, I was just, I think I just sort of decided to do the Azure, uh, oops. Um, what do you call it? The, as you're getting started with the L and we'll see how we go. So let's go ahead and uh, share my screen if uh anything is hard to read. Let me know. So, uh, first couple of things I always do. I have, you know, Pulumi is already installed if we take a look, ploy version pretty up to date, you know, I think we're OK. We'll, we'll leave it where we're at. And um, normally you'd have to make sure you've got the appropriate run time, whether it's Python or node or anything. The good thing is it's Yaml, there is no run time. So that's pretty easy. And then finally, we just need to make sure that uh in this case, I'm gonna be configuring Azure. So I already have the Azure cli installed. It's authorized, it's already set up so we can just dig into some Pulumi here um for, for fun. Uh because Yaml is fun. Right? Sweet. OK. So the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna make a new directory called the L. Call it the Yaml Camel. That's our project and we're just gonna switch over into there. Now, we are going to go ahead and do a Pulumi new Azure. Yeah. All this is gonna be fun for me because I've never seen what happens. OK. So you know, normal Pulumi stuff project name is inherited from the directory description, create the stack and we want Sure West us sounds good. OK. So let's see what it does make. Wow, it gave us a Pulumi. So this is new and different, right? So normally you have a Pulumi dot Yaml which just has this metadata, but now we have all this other stuff. This is kind of cool. This is some actual Pulumi in the Yamal. Um And if we kind of take a look in our project, we've got our name, you know, the run time is easy enough and then we have all these resources and then our DEV remember this shows our configuration um um uh that's specific to the stack to the DEV stack that we're doing. So this is really and this I need is this is just was hanging out. Um We don't need that. That was just me getting some room for some stuff. OK? So let's kind of take a look. We create a resource group and we specify the type. So it knows it's using Azure native. Um I'm really curious how it, where it pulls this stuff from, right? How it knows what we have and then an Azure resource that we have, you know, it's the type storage storage account and then we're able to sort of pull this info. OK? So, you know, we expand out because we created a resource group which has a dot Name. Um, yeah, this all looks like normal stuff. Ok. So, just out of curiosity though, like, let's see if we said I don't get any kind of type of head stuff in here because it's, em, it doesn't have a library or anything. That makes sense. Ok. So, if we were gonna go ahead and do a gloomy up should just work like regular old Pulumi that we're used to. It's gonna, ok. And create the resources. Cool. That's easy enough. Let that go. And yep, it said that, you know, it's gonna create the storage account, the resource group. Wow. Yeah. So where I guess Pulumi knows to pull these plugins and stuff because of because of this. So OK. So that did that stuff. So we could, yeah, if we really wanted to. OK. So after we create the storage account, we're gonna create a static website because this is just our normal little testing. OK? This was OK. S A was the storage account. OK. So over here then we'll do static website, right? Is type Azure native storage storage account website. OK. Properties. That doesn't count name, which is gonna be R as far as to count that name. OK. And the resource group name sense that that will be resource group name. And what's the last thing? Oh, the index document is index dot HCL. OK? Oh, except it's, it's Yeah. Well, Maddie strings just are in for OK? Oh uh Let's go ahead and we need our index dot html file. OK. Cool. All right. Um So we did static website and then we need to do one more resource to get the uh index at html up there. So call that one index, which is a type Azure native storage lob copies. It would be nice if it had, I don't know. I'm trying to figure out how you could get type ahead though because what's it getting this from a package or anything types? So resource seat. That's why the source. Oh my God, there we go. Um account name also. We need to have it here. A container name. Just did this on a on a meet up. I just did all this in dot net. So te like websites, it should know all these parameters. Uh All these properties are the synthetic website container name and then we need to know the source. Yeah, Pakistan. Ah Good question. OK. So is it possible to start using YAML on a project that already uses a programming language? You can't mix them in the same project. But if what you had that was already written in Python, you could create that as a component that was published as a library which then uh that you could wrap that in your your YAML project, which is really one of the places I'm seeing. Um a lot of the potential for this is that a lot of the complex logic of your Infra code could be, you could write that and go or in Python or whatever and publish it as a, as a multi-language component that could then just get consumed in the small little building blocks of resources. Um Like this. Yeah. So uh that was the file asset and I wanna figure out how to I've been content type, text, email, fame, smell type is black. OK? And then under our outputs, we also just wanna dump out static and points to go to the essay dot Hi Mary and complaints dot web. So let's so we kind of do that fun stuff. Let's go ahead and right line 46. Oh, because that should be a dollar sign. All right. Well, let that go ahead. All right. So that, and then if we were just to sit there and say curl gloomy stack output. Uh Yeah. Yeah, we like to say the El Cam. Yem Camel, Yel, Camel Yel Yum is the thing. Um So I'm trying to see what I can find out about what we could do that lets us get. Um ok, because I haven't really played yet with uh like where does Pulumi Yamal get this from? Ok. Pulumi Yamal reference guide. OK. Resources. OK. Because normally you'd load it in as a library or something for whatever provider you want to use. But how do you tell it? Does it just figure it out from a name space? Ah, yeah, that's all it's the language provider. But let's see. Me getting started. Yeah. Oh. Hm. That's a really good question. Ok. I, I'm trying to figure this out and let's poke around. Maybe we'll, uh, share my screen as we look through the, uh, through the internet here. Um, so I was trying to look a little bit at the project itself here at the language provider. So. All right. Yeah. Mm. Because what does it, huh. Let's see. Ok. So this is telling us. OK. Yep. Let me plug and install. That's fine. OK. We have a bunch of examples. Um Yeah. So this type, so where do these types come from? Are they? This seems like a really good, good thing. I don't want to figure out um I'm gonna ask a question and see if anybody knows. Um Somebody was sending me a message. All right. Well, so that didn't give us anything. But let's look at some of these other examples of things we can do. Um That's the getting started. Gloomy variable. Hm. Right. Yeah. These are still all because they're all just coming from the resource always starts with AWS. So like where is it? Load these from? It's very interested. It's not a Camel though PJ, I can tell you that. All right. Well, um let's see if you look at the blog and probably wrote something. Um Yeah. Oh, no, that's not the blog. Let's OK. Let's see what we see here. Ok. So this is all right. So this example. Ok, that's the Eks package. But where did that? Wow. There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with this, but I'm not quite sure where it goes. All right. Well, let's see. What's we are all the animal engineers. Um, because it's giving us the, the example of this is using the Eks package. Wow. Hm. Well, let's take a look at some other stuff around. Uh, Yeah, let's if we look at, I don't think we have no, we don't have those in there, but let's look at our fundamentals for. Yeah, I'll see if there's anything that gives me any ideas. Yeah. See it's still because it's darker which we know. Let me see what I can find in community slack. All right. Um Oh yeah, I feel like we keep having this conversation about how. Yeah. Yeah, because we keep going into this thing where we have an Eks package that can be consumed in Yaml, but I don't know where it gets that from. This is very confusing. All right. Well, um you're watching me learn and ask a lot of questions. All right. Well, what else can we learn about eml? Let's see. Let's look at languages. Let's read more about L OK. So we talked about the getting started. We had the different templates. Wow. So if we look back at the reference guide, OK. Right. Yeah. OK. All right. So those are outputs variables. Wife I feel like I'm missing something really blatantly obvious here, but I can't see where there's anything that tells it where these providers come from. It's just, there's nothing, nothing hiding. Hm. Yeah, this might be about as far as I can get with this right now because I'm, I'm kind of running into a block. Um, well, we've seen that we could create some stuff that was pretty easy if I could figure out how to tell it how to get it other. Actually. Well, you know what, I'm gonna try something, just wacky. Let me find, I'm gonna try to find like one of these non native providers. All right. Let's see. So let's go to dot com. All right, let's, let's, let's see if we were to look at, for example, um, actually have all zero stuff config I ready to configure. Ok. So, installation and configuration. Yep, we got all that stuff. Ok. So then if we wanted to create, like, let's just say a user in a zero. Ok. So this gives us some example. So it must be that it has to come from the registry because, yeah. Wow. Yeah. So that's my best guess right now is that, that it's looking up, it has to be published in the registry, which doesn't, it seems like something's missing. Well, I'm gonna try to find out about this. Um, when I find out a little bit more I will, will tweet about it. So, follow me on, on Twitter, maybe I'll put some comments on the youtube. Um But also tomorrow, if you want to dig in a little bit more into this, if you go to Pulumi dot com slash resources, you'll see we have a workshop. Um Coming up is this introduction and for sure sure is code with Pulumi Ya. I'll just drop this into the chat. Um If you wanna come and register for that.
