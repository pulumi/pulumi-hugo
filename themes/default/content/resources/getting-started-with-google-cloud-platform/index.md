    description: |
        Google Cloud’s product offering is continuously evolving, and infrastructure tools often can’t keep up with the speed of innovation. Pulumi’s Google Cloud Native provider is built directly from the Google Cloud API, bringing power of familiar programming languages to Google Cloud without sacrificing on latest features.

        In this workshop, we’ll use the Google Cloud native provider to build infrastructure using Pulumi’s TypeScript SDK and examine some of the features not previously possible.
