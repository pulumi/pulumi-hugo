    Welcome to your Quick Fight of Cloud engineering. I'm Laura. And today we're here to chat about platforms. So what exactly are platforms? You may have heard people talking about platform engineering or seen a job post for a platform engineer in the most general sense. A platform is a set of tools and systems that you can build more things on top of. That's nice. But why is this suddenly a thing with cloud engineering? The current holy grail of an organization that moves at speed is the ability for a developer to deploy an application with all of the necessary cloud based infrastructure without the need to interrupt another team or wait for tickets to be closed out a quality known as self service. That sort of idea requires a team that builds and maintains tooling and templates that stamp cloud based infrastructure on demand based on shared structures like accounts with cloud providers or multisystem search clusters. A platform enables any application in an organization to take advantage of working at scale from optimized billing to instantaneous capacity. Having a platform engineering team ensures that all of the various pockets of application development in a company can benefit from the expertise and best practices of a team of experts. And that team of experts can ensure the whole company follows the same policies they've curated without narrowing down technology options. Note that I'm specifically not naming tools here, you can build a platform with any number of combinations of tools. It's not the sole realm of say a popular tool like kubernetes, you will find a lot of similar abstractions. Though on a platform, for example, you likely will find that a platform has an API or another kind of interface to work from. And it's probably managed with infra infrastructure as code in some shape or form. It also allows teams to try using alternative tools without too much trouble due to that API or a standard interface. In short A platform abstracts the needs of a team delivering features to end users away into compos building blocks that fit into a shared infrastructure. It has a team of experts who own the shared infrastructure and who define the best practices at a company for putting those building blocks together. Those experts are able to provide support to other teams. The product teams in turn own the infrastructure they build on top of that shared platform. And inevitably because of their shared nature that heavily optimizes for speed and performance platforms are likely somewhere on a cloud. This has been your quick bite of cloud engineering for this week if you like this video and want to see more. Please do like and subscribe to our channel and check out the quick bits playlist. Also, if you want to learn about something specific, leave me a note down in the comments. I do read those or open an issue in our github repo that I'm linking in the description. I'll be back in just two weeks for another quick bite. Take care. Bye. Hey Cloud engineers. Laura here. I'm just here to remind you that if you have a topic you would love to have us cover here on Pulumi TV. All you have to do is go to github dot com slash Pulumi slash Pulumi TV. You can add an issue there and let us know what topic you'd like us to talk about. Thanks so much. Bye.
