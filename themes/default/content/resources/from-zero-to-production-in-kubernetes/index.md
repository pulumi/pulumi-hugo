    description: |
        Setting up your production Kubernetes environment brings many benefits including scalability and portability for your applications. Before you reach production, It’s important to understand key Kubernetes concepts and architectures available to keep your clusters secure and scalable. Ingress controllers are vital parts of any Kubernetes platform and NGINX ingress controller provides the best in class traffic management solution for cloud native apps and containerized environments.

        It’s important to use repeatable mechanisms to handle your ingress objects and controller deployments. Adopting infrastructure as code provides a mechanism to easily deploy production-ready applications in a repeatable manner. In this workshop, we’ll explore how to leverage the power of Python with Pulumi, an infrastructure as code platform to define and manage your Kubernetes deployments and build powerful abstractions that make getting to production easier than ever before.
