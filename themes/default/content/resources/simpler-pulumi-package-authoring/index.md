    description: |
        Let’s explore how to start sharing Pulumi code with others. We’ll use Go to build a custom architecture for GCP that we’ll then compile down into a library we can share with others who work in other languages.

        If you want to code along, you’ll need a [free Pulumi SaaS account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/), [the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/), [Go](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/go/), and a Google Cloud account (free tier is okay).

    # The webinar presenters
    presenters:
        - name: Ringo De Smet
          role: Customer Experience Consultant, Pulumi

    # A bullet point list containing what the user will learn during the webinar.
