  title: "Cloud Property Search: Find Any Resource Across Your Clouds with Pulumi Cloud"
  description: |
    We launched Resource Search for Pulumi Cloud to offer multi-cloud resource search and analytics across every cloud environment in your organization. Now, we’ve exposed a much larger set of data to search over: resource properties.   With Cloud Property Search,  you can search on an even richer variety of dimensions - everything from instance type, to database version, to region and availability zone, to whether resources are open to the internet. You can craft expressive queries that serve key compliance, operational, and diagnostic use cases.  Learn more at https://www.pulumi.com/blog/property-search/  Pulumi Resource Search, including the ability to search on property data, is applicable across all cloud resources, whether they reside in AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or any of Pulumi’s 100+ cloud providers. Support for querying on property data is available in the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud.

    In April, we launched a new feature as Joe mentioned called resource search. This extended the capability of the Pulumi cloud beyond just managing your infrastructure's code to managing your entire cloud footprint. When landing on the resources page, you can immediately see insights about your organization such as the type package projects, stacks and teams by resource count. You can click on search facets to narrow down your search and refine it further. The search syntax is similar to other tools you might have used like github. Now let's walk through a use case. Let's say we want to find all of our resources that are in Azure, I can type package Azure. This will return both Azure classic resources and Azure native resources. Today, I'm super excited to announce that we are taking this one step further and opening up a much larger set of data to search over resource properties. I was already able to find resources by things like the urn, the parent, the provider, the team they're in and so on. But today, any property on your resource will be indexed by Pulumi cloud and searchable after each update. Let's walk through an example. We often hear from customers that they wanna see the, they wanna search over the cloud tags that they're using in our environment. We use the cloud tag stack production. So I'm using a dot in the syntax to de to denote it as a property instead of as a column. And so we know that tags is a property, so it starts with a period and then the key value is stock production and you can see all of our resources with that property are return. Let's walk through another example. This one is also quite common in our feedback from customers. If we want to look by a certain availability zone, I can just type availability zone with the open col colon. And that will give me every resource that has the tag availability zone and we can refine it further by specifying what the value is. So I can say us S two A and then it'll further refine it by just those with that value, there can be dozens of resource properties on a resource. And so we can use A I SI S to help us generate the query syntax A I systems is our natural language search. In this case, let's say I want to look at my organization and see if we're using any versions of my sequel that are going to be end of life this year. So I'm gonna type show my Aurora engines using version five and give that to a I assist and it will convert into our query syntax. So as you can see here, it knows that I'm looking for an R DS cluster with the engine Aurora and the engine version five. Now, the reason I said five and not 5.7 for example, is this search will catch all of the five dot versions. So one resource is return, meaning that we are running 5.7 in our organization. And so we'll need to go and update it before it's end of life. I can also quickly change this to eight and see all of our R DS clusters that have already been updated to be my SQL 8.0 we can also run searches to ensure compliance. Pulumi policy code will prevent users from deploying resources that are against your internal policies such as a cloud blob storage that's exposed to the internet, but we can use search to validate compliance use cases. So let's look at this one specifically S3 buckets in production and I was lazy here. So I just said read, write. Now let's see if A I si knows what I mean. Perfect. So this converts it to, I'm looking for the type of resource S3 bucket in the stack production and it knows that the property is ac L public greed, right? And luckily we have none in our production environments. I can just remove the right and I can see any buckets that are set as public greed, which in this case, I know these buckets are intentionally set that way. Now, we'll do one last example of property search in the U I all the searches I've shown you we can do for any cloud provider. So in this case, instead of having to figure out what the resource type name is, let's ask a is to write us a query to find all bucket objects across the various clouds. So A I assist will return a syntax for aws, GCP and Azure and it looks like it got all of the syntax correct. Now, you can have all this data at your fingertips. But searching isn't the only thing you can do with it. You can also export it to perform analytics which could be something as simple as dumping it into a spreadsheet and using a pivot table or something as complex as using our data export API to regularly pull it into your data warehouse and build SQL queries or visualizations over it. But the value of resource search or property search isn't limited to the U I and analytics. You can also leverage the resource search API for automation and to create workflows off of your search results. But I won't just tell you, I'll show you now here I have a Python script called search dot py, which I can input any search query and then it will return the results. And so in this case, what I'm gonna try and do is check our staging environment to see if there are any instances that are still running. Now for our staging environment, we try and clean it up every Friday. So I want a quick way to be able to just see if there's any instances still running and then we can go and make sure that they're uh destroyed. So in this case, I'm doing the dot instance type so that you can specify anything that has an instance type properly regardless of what the instance type is. I know my project name and I know that my stack is staging. Now, running the script returns three results and I can check at a glance of what the instance type is for each of them to know if there's something I particularly want to clean up. I can also link directly back to the Pulumi console and then click on the AWS console link. So in 50 lines of code, you can write a script that checks every Friday and you could potentially run it in a Lambda function. And if there's results, you could send those results um in a notification to notify your team, you could, if connected to Pulumi deployments, you could also take it one step further and use the Pulumi deployments S api to destroy these resources instead of having to manually clean them up.
