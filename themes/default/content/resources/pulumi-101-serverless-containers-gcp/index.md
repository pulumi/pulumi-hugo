    description: |
        Learn the basics of Pulumi from projects to components. We’ll use Python and templates to stand up our first bit of infrastructure: A small set of serverless containers on Cloud Run from Google Cloud. Along the way, we’ll learn how infrastructure as code makes updates easier, reduces time to value, and helps you keep your cloud costs down.

        If you want to code along, you’ll need a [free Pulumi SaaS account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/), [the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/), [Python 3.9.x](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/python/), and a Google Cloud account (free tier is okay).

        - name: Tushar Shah
          role: Senior Customer Engineer, Pulumi
