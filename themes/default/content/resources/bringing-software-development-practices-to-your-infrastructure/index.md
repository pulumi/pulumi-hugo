        The cloud makes it easier and quicker to provision infrastructure at scale, but there is added complexity with that scale. By bringing practices from software development like test driven development, automated testing, and continuous integration/deployment to manage complexity at each stage of the pipeline, you can build and manage your cloud resources more effectively, consistently, and more securely.
