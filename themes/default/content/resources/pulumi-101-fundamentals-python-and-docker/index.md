    Learn the basics of Pulumi from projects to components. We’ll use Python and Docker to build, configure, and deploy a real-life, modern application with related infrastructure: a system that runs the fictitious Pulumipus Boba Tea Shop. Along the way, we’ll learn how infrastructure as code makes updates easier, reduces time to value, and helps you keep your cloud costs down.

    If you want to code along, you’ll need a free Pulumi SaaS account, the Pulumi CLI, Python 3.9.x, and Docker installed and running on your machine.
