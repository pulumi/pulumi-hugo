    Discover Pulumi AI, your new AI assistant purpose-built for creating cloud infrastructure, using Pulumi. Pulumi AI builds on the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).  and GPT to dramatically reduce the time it takes to discover, learn and use new cloud infrastructure APIs.   You can ask in natural language how to accomplish your Cloud Infrastructure goal and get back a Pulumi program in your language of choice. You can iterate on the cloud infrastructure along with the AI assistant, adding new features, fixing bugs, and clarifying requirements.  Check out Pulumi AI today: https://pulumi.com/ai

    Pulumi A I is a new A I based assistant that is purpose built for creating cloud infrastructure using Pulumi with Pulumi A I. You can use GP T enabled A I to help you discover what I ac to use for your specific natural language requirements. And then iterate on that with the A I assistant. In this example, we ask Pulumi I to create an EC2 instance in AWS and then add new requirements and features to iterate on our infrastructure. We can change languages, we can work with any of the 130 supported cloud and SAS providers in the Plume platform. Pulumi I is also available as a CLI application you can run locally which takes the these ideas even further with the Pulumi A IC built on GPT and Pulumi automation API you could interactively develop cloud infrastructure and applications running in the cloud using only natural language. In this example, we built a static website in AWS S3 live on the internet using just a few prompts. When it makes a mistake, we can ask it to fix the problem and it does when we want to be more creative, we can ask it and adds additional details to our application. And when we're done, we can inspect the pluming program it generates and then have it clean up after itself. This is a truly incredible power to put in the hands of A I but also an incredible potential for improved productivity and learning. Check out Pulumi dot com slash A I to get started with Pulumi AI today.
