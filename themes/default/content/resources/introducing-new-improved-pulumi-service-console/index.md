    Today, we're launching a significant set of improvements to the overall user experience of the Pulumi service console. Now, before I jump into that and walk you through all the changes, let's go over what the plumbing service is. The Pulumi service is the easiest way to use. Plume's open source universal infrastructures code SDK at scale as it's a fully managed service, it provides teams and works with secure state and secrets management increases developer velocity and collaboration through dashboards and tooling integrations and enables admins to set guard rails and access controls. Now let's dive into it. I'm signing in via SSO that's what my organization uses. Once I send in, I'm going to land on my individual org page. This gives me kind of just like a quick, where do I start? Summary? But I'm going to jump straight to my organization dashboard. And here you can see that we've added a new summary of member count, total stacks and total resources and how those have changed over the week. You can see your latest stack updates, what's been changed recently, any commit message if it's associated and you can jump directly to the details of that update. Now, we've added a new feature called favorite stacks in which you can store any of your stacks and quickly access them from the dashboard or from the new left side navigation. We have a new members card which summarizes which members have recently joined your org as well as if there's any pending invites. As you can see on the left side, we've added this new navigation bar which allows you to quickly jump from your favorite stacks to any of your settings or features like policies. Now, favorite snacks in an organization are specific to you. So these are the stacks that you find most relevant and your teammates may have entirely different favorites. Now, if we want to walk through a specific stack, we can jump to it from anywhere on my favorite stacks or on the dashboard, I can see its recent activity uh when it's been updated. And by who I can see a list of the resources that are inside this stack and I can search through them to find what I'm looking for specifically where relevant I can jump directly to the cloud console for that resource. And lastly, I can view a graph of how these resources relate to each other. Now, if I'm on the enterprise, oh And one last thing if I want to set up C I CD for this stack, I can jump into our C I CD assistant, which is in the settings of the stack. Now, here you'll find you can choose from any of these C I CD providers and set up the connection to that reboot. If I'm on enterprise or business critical uh Pulumi service edition, I have access to policy as code. Now, policy is code empowers you to set guard rails so that your developers can work within an organization while sticking to your best practices and security compliance. I can also look through my audit logs in my organization. As you can see, I've logged in quite a few times doing this demo, but I've also created a team token and I can see that activity on the auto. Now, this has just been a high level summary of some of the changes and the key features of the plume service console. We hope you continue to give us feedback on your experience using it and that you enjoy the changes we've made based on user feedback.
