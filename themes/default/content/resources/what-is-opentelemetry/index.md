    description: |
        Microservices have broken monitoring tools and practices. Traditional methods of application logging and host-based metrics canâ€™t provide accurate and timely signals for issues impacting production. OpenTelemetry solves this dilemma by providing a single set of APIs, SDKs, and automatic instrumentation tools that give you the ability to understand your distributed system and the performance of individual services within it.
