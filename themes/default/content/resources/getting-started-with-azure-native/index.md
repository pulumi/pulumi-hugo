    description: |
        Microsoft Azure’s product offering is continuously evolving, and infrastructure tools often can’t keep up with the speed of innovation. Pulumi’s Azure Native provider is built directly from the Azure API, bringing power of familiar programming languages to Azure without sacrificing on latest features.

        In this workshop, we’ll use the Azure native provider to build infrastructure using Pulumi’s TypeScript SDK and examine some of the features not previously possible.
