        In this workshop, weâ€™re going to learn more about cloud computing and Infrastructure as Code by exploring how to use Pulumi to build, configure, and deploy a real-life, modern application using Docker. We will create a frontend, a backend, and a database to deploy the Pulumipus Boba Tea Shop, and along the way, learn more about how Pulumi works to make managing all of these different moving pieces a little bit less painful!
