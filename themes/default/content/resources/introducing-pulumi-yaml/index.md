    Hi there, I'm Laura Santa Maria developer advocate at Pulumi. And today I'm delighted to introduce you to our new Yaml language provider. Yes, I did say Yaml from the very beginning of Pulumi, our goal has been to ensure everyone has universal access to the cloud and infrastructure with the best language for their use case. And for some people using something other than one of our general purpose programming languages is the best choice for their use case. Perhaps someone doesn't know a general programming language and needs another way to declare their desired state of their infrastructure while they get a chance to learn the language of their choice. Perhaps an organization needs an alternative to live alongside the Pulumi deployments that use general purpose programming languages. An alternative that is for teams who want a declarative language for a single file or a small program or for platform engineers who want to describe a simple use case for developers to use. One of the beautiful things about Pulumi is that all of these languages can live together harmoniously and make your cloud based infrastructure shine. And that list of languages now includes YAML. Why YAML, we needed a data serialization language that was familiar to many people. Yaml has been the language of choice for systems like Kubernetes and it's in use for systems like cloud formation. The Yaml provider also supports Jason. So you have the best of both worlds in this case, as you can use either Yaml or Jason to declare your desired infrastructure state. By virtue of comparing YAML to general purpose programming languages. You'll notice that we can't use Yaml to define complex logic as you would for other Pulumi languages as such. The Yaml provider is intended for less complex, more direct Pulumi programs in terms of our resource model. YAML supports everything from assets to resources to secrets to stack references, basically everything except loops conditionals, user defined functions in libraries and transformations. We also expect that you'll write any special components using a general purpose programming language rather than YAML to take advantage of those programming language constructs. And you can then use those language constructs in Yaml as a sort of escape hatch in short while it's considered simpler. It's far from second class in the Pulumi ecosystem. Alrighty. And here we are, I'm just gonna do a really, really quick list of what's here. So that's an LS dash L A which shortens to ll on my system. You'll be able to see that I have a Pulumi dot YAML file already set up in index dot html, which will see why it's there in a moment and a plume dot DEV file. Let's take a look at that Pulumi dot Yaml file, shall we? So we're gonna first clear it. So y'all can see what I'm up to and then we're gonna just count that Pulumi Yaml file and we can see there's a few different things going on here. So let's start up here at the top. We have the name of the file in this case. It is just simply Yaml. I didn't really give my project much of the name of anything. The run time is YAML and the description is basic from our GCP template. All of my resources are here. In this case, I have a bucket. This is just gonna be a GCP storage bucket and I have a little website which is just simply an html page that's going to be up there. I have some binding. So that's that I am binding that we already have. And you can see the roll is in there and the index object itself. So just everything that you would find in a standard Pulumi program including the outputs which are down here at the bottom, the outputs themselves are just going to give me a URL and a bucket end point. All right. Are you ready to run it? I think I am. So let's go just run a Pulumi up if you wanted to run Pulumi preview just to see what it looks like you could do that. But Pulumi up gives us the preview as we're going. So I generally prefer just to run that and see what it gives me. This gives me my bucket, my binding and my bucket object. It should be fairly simple to see. This should look like every other Pulumi program. So if we look at the details, you'll find all of that information just as you would for any other Pulumi program written in another language. So I'm gonna just hit. Yes. And we're going to stand everything up and we get our bucket, we get our object, our binding all of those different bits and pieces and we get our outputs. Just as you would see, you can also tell that I need to update my Pulumi cli, I'll get to that in a little bit, but let's actually just curl this. So as with any Pulumi program, you can curl the stack output in. Well, if you're trying to actually reach this, but you can call the stack output itself. So we're gonna just call the bucket end point here as a curl and we should get back my little html file that just says hello Pulumi. So there we have it here is our YAML provider. So it is just as you would expect all the little bits and pieces that you typically find in our providers. There's one more thing I want you to have in your tool kit and that's our language converter that takes a Yaml program and converts it to any Pulumi language. This converter can generate a Pulumi program in any of our officially supported languages, enabling you to take your simple use case that might have gotten more complex and translate it to a different language as you scale up the complexity of your infrastructure. So there we have it. That's the new YAML provider in a nutshell. If you've got questions or comments, leave us a note here in the comments on Twitter, stop by our slack or drop us an email. We're always listening and we are here to help. We're showing the provider off at Pulumi up and we'll leave links to a few more videos demonstrating the provider in the description. Once we have them, if you're excited about the new provider, like subscribe, comment and share this video, I'll see you soon. Take care. Bye.
