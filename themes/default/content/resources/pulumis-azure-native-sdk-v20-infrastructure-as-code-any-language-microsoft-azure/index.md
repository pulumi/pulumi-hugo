    New Microsoft Azure Native Provider 2.0 (GA) is more powerful than ever. The Azure Native provider offers the most complete support for Azure possible - with same-day access to the entire surface area of the Azure features from Azure Resource Manager. Every property of each module is always represented in the SDKs.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Faster development: SDK size reduced by 50% ‚ñ™Ô∏è Refreshed defaults to latest and greatest from Azure ‚ñ™Ô∏è Expanded Azure API version coverage  üî•Learn about Azure Native 2.0 at https://www.pulumi.com/blog/introducing-azure-native-v2/

    All right. Well, let's get started with using Pulumi to build cloud infrastructure. We'll start here inside our terminal and just run Pulumi new. When we do this, we see that we have over 200 templates for a wide variety of different use cases for the cloud. We have a variety of cloud providers like Azure, Aws and a variety of others. And we have to support a number of different languages like typescript, Python go dot net and Pulumi Amal. We also have a variety of different architectures. And so here we see, we can deploy a containerized service on Azure using Python. We'll go ahead and give this a name Pulumi up 2023. We'll put in some default meditator and we'll make sure this is running close to us in the West US. This is going to install a bunch of dependencies just like any normal Python project. But let's go over the VS code and take a look at what this code looks like. So here we have our code just like we mentioned, this is just a normal Python project with the requirements dot TXT, a virtual environment and of course a main dot py file. Now, I'll walk through the code in just a second. But first, the one thing that's a bit unusual or new about Pulumi is that instead of just running our Python program as a Python program, we run it using Pulumi up. And that actually allows us to run this in a desired state configuration mode just like you would with Azure resource manager, cloud formation, Terraform KTIS or any other infrastructures code tool. When we run Pulumi up, we see that it first gives a preview. So it runs my code in a mode where I can see what will happen. Even before I go and deploy this. We see that what will happen is we'll deploy a few resources, a resource group in Azure, a container registry in Azure. We'll build and push a local docker image and then we'll run that in Azure container instances. We can go and say yes that we do want to deploy this and they'll go ahead and start deploying that infrastructure. Now, this will take about a minute to deploy. And so while we wait for it to finish deploying into Azure, let's take a look at the code and some of the benefits we get from Pulumi infrastructures code. So the first benefit is that because this is just code in an existing program language that has great support within our ID. We get things like autocomplete and dot completion. We can see all the different API S that are available like image registry, image, remote image. And so many more things, we can also see that we can use features like go to definition to dive into that library and understand the details of it. So for example, here we see an overview of how this works. We see examples and we see the entire set of properties that are available to work with. Now ID completion like that is one thing, but we also get that quick feedback loop. So for example, if I come up here and make some changes like this, we'll see that if I have a Typo in my code, I immediately get that feedback that there's a problem and I can fix it as I'm going not having to wait for me to deploy and have that issue affect us later on in the deployment. Similarly, if I type the pass the wrong kind of data in like I pass a string instead of a bull in here, we see that we get that feedback immediately. Overall, this provides a much more strongly typed experience where I get great editor and ID E feedback and productivity from that. Now, in this case, we're using the Azure native provider, which is a full fidelity mapping of the entire Azure platform into Pulumi. This is something we work closely with the Azure team at Microsoft on and it provides the best possible experience for the Azure platform. And earlier this week, we released Azure native V two which provides increased performance and usability features for the Azure native provider. This provider offers things that go even further like enum that tell us all the legal values for this particular setting. So for example, for the skew on a container registry, we know that there's these exact four values. And if I mistype it, I get that same feedback. So a whole bunch of features to help with productivity. Now, this has gone ahead and finished deploying and so I can click on this to open it up and we'll see that our app is now running inside Azure. And so here we go, we're running an application inside Azure container instances that shows hello world. Now it turns out that application was built uh from this Docker file that's just locally here as part of that template. And so we have this simple Docker file that we were building and pushing locally and we have the app dot pi file that we're running. And so let me make a change to this and we'll see what happens when we go ahead and deploy that. So if I rerun Pulumi up, we'll see that because Pulumi is an infrastructures code tool that's using desired state. We're not going to just recreate everything. We're going to figure out what is the minimum change possible to, to get to the new state that we want. And it turns out that minimum change is to make two changes to our infrastructure. One is to build and push the new copy of this image, which has that code change I made. And the other one is to update our container instance to run that new code. I go ahead and click details to see exactly what's going to change. And yes, to go ahead and start deploying those updates. Now this will take a couple of minutes so we won't wait for it to finish. Um But you get the idea, you can use Pulumi to manage the entire life cycle of your infrastructure's code projects as they evolve over time.
