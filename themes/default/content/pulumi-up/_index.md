    PulumiUP is for anyone who is interested in cloud engineering,
    cloud infrastructure, software development, modern applications, or Pulumi.
    Whether you’re a seasoned cloud engineer or just curious to learn what’s all
    the fuss about cloud engineering, PulumiUP will teach you something new about
    the future of building on the cloud.

    In the first part of the event you will hear from Pulumi CEO and Co-Founder Joe Duffy and technical
    leaders of pioneering companies as they present the vision for the future of cloud engineering and
    what it means for people and teams leveraging cloud infrastructure and modern applications.

    During part two, Joe Duffy and Pulumi CTO Luke Hoban will walk us through new announcements about Pulumi's
    Cloud Engineering Platform and present demos with help from assorted Pulumi team members. You will
    learn about all the new features and capabilities we've been cooking up in the last year.

    Finally in the last part of the event you will hear from technical leaders across the industry and a collection
    of Pulumi customers about how they have adopted Cloud Engineering best practices and how those practices have
    helped them be successful in this new era of software development.
