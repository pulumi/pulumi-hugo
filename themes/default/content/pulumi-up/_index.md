      title: Engineering a Multi-cloud Platform
      description: |
        Many teams invest considerable time in defining architectures unique to a cloud service provider - only to discover the need to support a different cloud provider due to regional availability requirements, mergers, or new supply chain restrictions. In this session, Tim Holm, CTO at Nitric, will introduce key concepts and challenges that every team must consider when planning for cloud-agnostic delivery including
          - Platform abstraction
          - Developer experience
          - Self-service Infrastructure
          - Team productivity

        Tim will also share how his team leveraged the Pulumi platform to build a cloud-agnostic toolset for developers.

      title: Creating a ‘Cloud-Aware’ Code Solution
      description: |
        Ala will share how Pulumi enables a new category of “cloud-aware” developer tools that leverage familiar programming languages and can lower barriers to entry to deploying cloud infrastructure for small teams that lack dedicated infrastructure experts. 

        He’ll show how developers can easily create infrastructure from code using familiar languages and without having expertise with a given cloud provider. This enables rapid iteration on cloud applications for early-stage teams who are prototyping and iterating on new products.

      title: Lessons Learned from Writing Thousands of Lines of IaC
      description: |
        Immutable architecture is the backbone of infrastructure as code, to ensure production environments cannot be changed during runtime.  While this has the benefits of its inherent safety measures, this can also be restrictive.  

        This talk will focus on some of the fundamentals of immutable architecture, best practices and recommended design patterns to work around its limitations, as well as what you most certainly should not be doing when running immutable architecture. Tim will demonstrate it through a real-world example of using Pulumi to deploy a single-tenant SaaS in an automated pipeline, typical challenges encountered, and what was learned on the way.

      title: Creating Infrastructure Automation Magic with Code
      description: |
        What happens when you combine the expressiveness and flexibility of programming with infrastructure as code automation? Magic. 

        Join Matt as he demonstrates how Starburst uses Pulumi Automation API to increase the speed and accuracy of infrastructure operations (like blue-green deployments with Kubernetes clusters) with code. And learn how the Automation API has reduced complicated, unwieldy tasks into simpler tasks that are completely managed by code.

      title: How a bank modernized its software engineering with infrastructure as code automation
      description: |
        At financial institutions, data privacy and security aren't just best practices, they're Federal requirements. 

        Dennis shares how Washington Trust Bank has modernized its software development and infrastructure practices since migrating to Azure and adopting infrastructure as code. He will cover how his team enables developers with infrastructure components, prevents developers from deploying forbidden resources with CrossGuard policies, and uses automation to save time and effort.

      title: Using Monorepos to Level-up your Infrastructure as Code and Software Delivery
      description: |
        The way you structure your Pulumi projects and stacks in GitHub repositories can impact how well your organization ships infrastructure, especially when there are multiple teams of developers collaborating. 

        You will learn best practices for using monorepos with Pulumi and how this pattern has supported People Data Labs’ platform engineering team in delivering more efficient infrastructure deployments and updates, increased code sharing and reuse, and better collaboration.
