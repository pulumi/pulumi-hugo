We are happy to announce the Terraform Migration Offer, a set of migration services bundled into our Pulumi Enterprise and Business Critical Editions. Many of our users come to Pulumi from existing infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform. They choose Pulumi because of the increased productivity and ability to tame the complexity of the cloud thanks to the choice of any programming language. However, migrating existing IaC projects to Pulumi can come with challenges and time. Today, [we announced](/blog/converting-full-terraform-programs-to-pulumi) the ability to convert entire Terraform projects and modules to Pulumi directly from the Pulumi CLI. This can make migrations more seamless.

That said, many enterprises we work with have a lot of code to convert and not much time in which to do it. Today, we are excited to announce a new Terraform Migration Offer, which includes migration services from our expert customer engineers, bundled as part of Pulumi Enterprise and Business Critical Editions. As part of Pulumi Enterprise and Business Critical, we are including 10 and 30 Terraform workspace migrations, respectively, as part of the onboarding process. We will migrate all your Terraform HCL code to your favorite language and migrate the Terraform state. Additional workspace migrations can be purchased at an added cost.

The Terraform Migration Offer makes it easy to get onto Pulumi without becoming experts in migrating code and state. Contact us to take advantage of the offer today!
