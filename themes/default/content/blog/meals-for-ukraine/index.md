## How it works

Participating is easy. If you registered for KubeCon, just click on the booth links below to visit our virtual booths. Each visit will count as a $2 donation, so if you visit us all, that's $12 for the cause right there!

Of course, there are many more reasons to visit our booths. You'll find lots of great cloud native resources including demos, tutorials, ebooks, and more. Here are some of the highlights you can expect at each booth.

### Pulumi â€” Universal Infrastructure as Code

At [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)â€™s booth, you'll learn about their cloud engineering platform that brings infrastructure, developer, and security teams together through a unified software engineering process that tames cloud complexity and accelerates innovation. Don't miss Pulumi's Ask an Expert live sessions to hear directly from the engineering team. Whether you want to know more about how to build with Universal Infrastructure as Code in general-purpose programming and markup languages or just learn more about what's on the roadmap, this is your chance to ask anything.
