## Create an AWS S3 resource using AWS Classic

The [AWS Classic library](/registry/packages/aws/installation-configuration/) enables fine-grained control over the [AWS S3 resource](/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/s3/) meaning it can be coded, deployed, and managed entirely in code.

## Create an AWS S3 bucket using `@pulumi/cloud`

The `@pulumi/cloud` library provides a high-level abstraction over the AWS S3 resource ensuring the same code can be used in multi-cloud environments.

```javascript
const cloud = require("@pulumi/cloud-aws");
const aws = require("@pulumi/aws");

// A new bucket that will work in any cloud
const bucket = new cloud.Bucket("bucket");
```
