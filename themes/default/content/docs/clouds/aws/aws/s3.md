## Create an AWS S3 resource using `@pulumi/aws`

The `@pulumi/aws` library enables fine-grained control over the AWS S3 resource meaning it can be coded, deployed, and managed entirely in code.

```javascript
const aws = require("@pulumi/aws");

const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket");

const bucketMetric = new aws.s3.BucketMetric("my-bucket-metric", {
    bucket: bucket.bucket
});

const bucketNotification = new aws.s3.BucketNotification("my-bucket-notification", {
    bucket: bucket.bucket
});

const bucketObject = new aws.s3.BucketObject("my-bucket-object", {
    bucket: bucket.bucket,
    content: "hello world"
});

const bucketPolicy = new aws.s3.BucketPolicy("my-bucket-policy", {
    bucket: bucket.bucket,
    policy: bucket.bucket.apply(publicReadPolicyForBucket)
})

function publicReadPolicyForBucket(bucketName: string) {
    return JSON.stringify({
        Version: "2012-10-17",
        Statement: [{
            Effect: "Allow",
            Principal: "*",
            Action: [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            Resource: [
                `arn:aws:s3:::${bucketName}/*` // policy refers to bucket name explicitly
            ]
        }]
    });
}
```

## Create an AWS S3 bucket using `@pulumi/cloud`

The `@pulumi/cloud` library provides a high-level abstraction over the AWS S3 resource ensuring the same code can be used in multi-cloud environments.

```javascript
const cloud = require("@pulumi/cloud-aws");
const aws = require("@pulumi/aws");

// A new bucket that will work in any cloud
const bucket = new cloud.Bucket("bucket");
```
