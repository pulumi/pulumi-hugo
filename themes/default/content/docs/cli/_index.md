Pulumi is controlled primarily using the command line interface (CLI). It works in conjunction with the Pulumi Cloud
to deploy changes to your cloud apps and infrastructure. It keeps a history of who updated what in your team and when.
This CLI has been designed for great inner loop productivity, in addition to
[continuous integration and delivery](/docs/using-pulumi/continuous-delivery/) scenarios.

## Installation
