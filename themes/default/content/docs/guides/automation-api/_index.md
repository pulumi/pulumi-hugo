The Pulumi Automation API is a programmatic interface for running Pulumi programs without the Pulumi CLI. Conceptually, this can be thought of as encapsulating the functionality of the CLI (`pulumi up`, `pulumi preview`, `pulumi destroy`, `pulumi stack init`, etc.) but with more flexibility. It is a strongly typed and safe way to use Pulumi in embedded contexts such as web servers without having to shell out to a CLI.

Automation API allows you to define a Pulumi program as a function within your codebase rather than in a separate project and use methods to get and set configuration parameters programmatically. It uses a gRPC interface to execute programs that control and communicate with the core Pulumi engine.

Automation API requires the Pulumi CLI to be installed and available on your `PATH` environment variable.
