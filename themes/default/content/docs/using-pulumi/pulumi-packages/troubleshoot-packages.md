When developing or troubleshooting Pulumi providers, you may need to debug the provider code locally. This guide walks you through starting your provider in debug mode, setting breakpoints, and running tests.

## Starting the provider in debug mode

To setup a process to debug, you will need to start the provider in debug mode through your local IDE. Upon startup, the provider should output a port number to the console (e.g., `12345`), indicating it is ready for a debugger to attach. Here are two examples for GoLand and VS Code.

### Example for GoLand

For GoLand you can follow these steps.

1. Configure the working directory to the program you are going to run to mirror how Pulumi would start the provider

### Example for VS Code

For VS Code you can follow these steps.

1. Navigate to **Run -> Add Configuration** and add the **Go: launch package** configuration
2. Edit `"program": "${fileDirname}"` to point to `cmd/pulumi-resource-<PROVIDER>` , e.g., `cmd/pulumi-resource-azure-native` for the Azure Native provider

3. Edit "name": `"Launch Package"` to give it a descriptive name
4. Launch package

## Setting breakpoints

With your IDE configured, set breakpoints within the provider code where you wish to pause execution during debugging.

## Running Pulumi with debug providers

To attach the Pulumi CLI to your provider running in debug mode, use the `PULUMI_DEBUG_PROVIDERS` environment variable. Specify the provider and port number the debugger is listening on.

For example, to debug a deployment with the `azure-native` provider on port `12345`, you would run:

```shell
PULUMI_DEBUG_PROVIDERS="azure-native:12345" pulumi up
```

## Running tests

This approach also works for running tests, such as acceptance tests in a provider's examples folder. For instance:

```shell
cd pulumi-wavefront/examples
PULUMI_DEBUG_PROVIDERS="wavefront:53766" go test -v -tags=python
```

## Debugger attachment

Once Pulumi runs or tests are initiated with the `PULUMI_DEBUG_PROVIDERS` environment variable set, your IDE should automatically attach to the specified port and pause execution at your set breakpoints.

**Terminating the Provider Process**: Be cautious when terminating the provider process as the Pulumi state can get out of sync with the actual cloud resources. When in doubt, `pulumi refresh` will address this.
