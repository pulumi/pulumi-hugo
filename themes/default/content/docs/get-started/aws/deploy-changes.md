Now let's deploy your changes.

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

Pulumi will run the `preview` step of the update, which computes the minimally disruptive change to achieve the desired state described by the program.

```
Previewing update (dev):

     Type                    Name            Plan
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack     quickstart-dev
 +   └─ aws:s3:BucketObject  hello.txt       create

Resources:
    + 1 to create
    2 unchanged

Do you want to perform this update?
> yes
  no
  details
```

Choosing `yes` will proceed with the update and upload your `hello.txt` file to your bucket:

```
Do you want to perform this update? yes
Updating (dev):

     Type                    Name            Status
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack     quickstart-dev
 +   └─ aws:s3:BucketObject  hello.txt       created

Outputs:
    bucketName: "my-bucket-b9c2eaa"

Resources:
    + 1 created
    2 unchanged

Duration: 6s
```

Once the update has completed, you can verify the object was created in your bucket by checking the AWS Console or by running the following AWS CLI command:

{{< chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go,csharp,java,yaml" / >}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucket_name)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Notice that your `hello.txt` file has been added to the bucket:

```bash
2020-08-27 12:30:24         15 hello.txt
```

Next you will destroy the resources.
