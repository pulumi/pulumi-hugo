Now let's deploy your changes.

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

Pulumi will run the `preview` step of the update, which computes the minimally disruptive change to achieve the desired state described by the program.

```
Previewing update (dev):

     Type                    Name            Plan       Info
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack     quickstart-dev
 +   └─ aws:s3:BucketObject  index.html                 create

Resources:
    + 1 to create
    2 unchanged

Do you want to perform this update?
> yes
  no
  details
```

Choosing `yes` will proceed with the update and upload your `index.html` file to your bucket.

```

Updating (dev):

     Type                     Name            Status      Info
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack      quickstart-dev
  +   └─ aws:s3:BucketObject  index.html                  created

Outputs:
    bucketName: "my-bucket-68e33ec"

Resources:
    + 1 created
    2 unchanged

Duration: 6s
```

Once the update has completed, you can verify the object was created in your bucket by checking the AWS Console or by running the following AWS CLI command:

{{< chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go,csharp,java,yaml" / >}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucket_name)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash

```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

```bash

```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Notice that your `index.html` file has been added to the bucket:

```bash
2020-08-27 12:30:24         70 index.html
```

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program file to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website. First, set the `website` property on your bucket.

```javascript
const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket", {
    website: {
        indexDocument: "index.html",
    },
});
```

Next, your `index.html` object will need two changes: an ACL of `public-read` so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type so that it is served as HTML:

```javascript
const bucketObject = new aws.s3.BucketObject("index.html", {
    acl: "public-read",
    contentType: "text/html",
    bucket: bucket,
    source: new pulumi.asset.FileAsset("index.html"),
});
```

Finally, at the end of the program file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can easily access it:

```javascript
exports.bucketEndpoint = pulumi.interpolate`http://${bucket.websiteEndpoint}`;
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program file to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website. First, set the `website` property on your bucket.

```typescript
const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket", {
    website: {
        indexDocument: "index.html",
    },
});
```

Next, your `index.html` object will need two changes: an ACL of `public-read` so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type so that it is served as HTML:

```typescript
const bucketObject = new aws.s3.BucketObject("index.html", {
    acl: "public-read",
    contentType: "text/html",
    bucket: bucket,
    source: new pulumi.asset.FileAsset("index.html")
});
```

Finally, at the end of the program file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can easily access it:

```typescript
export const bucketEndpoint = pulumi.interpolate`http://${bucket.websiteEndpoint}`;
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program file to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website. First, set the `website` property on your bucket.

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket('my-bucket',
    website=s3.BucketWebsiteArgs(
        index_document="index.html",
    ))
```

Next, your `index.html` object will need two changes: an ACL of public-read so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type so that it is served as HTML:

```python
bucketObject = s3.BucketObject(
    'index.html',
    acl='public-read',
    content_type='text/html',
    bucket=bucket.id,
    source=pulumi.FileAsset('index.html'),
)
```

Finally, at the end of the program file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can easily access it:

```python
pulumi.export('bucket_endpoint', pulumi.Output.concat('http://', bucket.website_endpoint))
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website. First, set the `Website` property on your bucket.

```go
bucket, err := s3.NewBucket(ctx, "my-bucket", &s3.BucketArgs{
    Website: s3.BucketWebsiteArgs{
        IndexDocument: pulumi.String("index.html"),
    },
})
```

Next, your `index.html` object will need two changes: an ACL of public-read so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type so that it is served as HTML:

```go
_, err = s3.NewBucketObject(ctx, "index.html", &s3.BucketObjectArgs{
    Acl:         pulumi.String("public-read"),
    ContentType: pulumi.String("text/html"),
    Bucket:      bucket.ID(),
    Source:      pulumi.NewFileAsset("index.html"),
})
```

Finally, at the end of the program file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can easily access it:

```go
ctx.Export("bucketEndpoint", pulumi.Sprintf("http://%s", bucket.WebsiteEndpoint))
```

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website. First, set the `Website` property on your bucket.

```csharp
// Add this import
using Pulumi.Aws.S3.Inputs;
```

```csharp
var bucket = new Bucket("my-bucket", new BucketArgs
{
    Website = new BucketWebsiteArgs
    {
        IndexDocument = "index.html"
    }
});
```

Next, your `index.html` object will need two changes: an ACL of public-read so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type so that it is served as HTML:

```csharp
var bucketObject = new BucketObject("index.html", new BucketObjectArgs
{
    Acl = "public-read",
    ContentType = "text/html",
    Bucket = bucket.BucketName,
    Source = new FileAsset("index.html")
});
```

Finally, at the end of the program file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can easily access it:

```csharp
return new Dictionary<string, object?>
{
    ["bucketName"] = bucket.Id,
    ["bucketEndpoint"] = Output.Format($"http://{bucket.WebsiteEndpoint}")
};
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website.

First, add the `BucketArgs` and `BucketWebsiteArgs` classes to the list of imports.

```java
// ...
import com.pulumi.aws.s3.BucketArgs;
import com.pulumi.aws.s3.inputs.BucketWebsiteArgs;
```

Next, extend the `Bucket` declaration to include a `website` property containing the filename to use as an `indexDocument`:

```java
// ...
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pulumi.run(ctx -> {

            // Create an AWS resource (S3 Bucket)
            var bucket = new Bucket("my-bucket", BucketArgs.builder()
                .website(BucketWebsiteArgs.builder()
                    .indexDocument("index.html")
                    .build()
                )
                .build()
            );
```

Now add two properties to the `BucketObject`: an ACL of `public-read` so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type ensure it's served as HTML:

```java
// ...
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pulumi.run(ctx -> {
            // var bucket = ...

            // Create an S3 Bucket object
            new BucketObject("index.html", BucketObjectArgs.builder()
                .bucket(bucket.getId())
                .source(new FileAsset("index.html"))
                .acl("public-read")
                .contentType("text/html")
                .build()
            );
```

Finally, at the end of the program file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can access it easily. You can do that by importing the Pulumi `Output` class:

```java
// ...
import com.pulumi.core.Output;
```

And adding a line to read the endpoint from the `Bucket` instance:

```java
// ...
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pulumi.run(ctx -> {

            // ...
            ctx.export("bucketEndpoint", Output.format("http://%s", bucket.websiteEndpoint()));
        });
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

Now that your `index.html` is in your bucket, modify the program to have the bucket serve `index.html` as a static website. To do that, set the bucket's `website` property, passing the filename to use as an `indexDocument`:

```yaml
resources:
  my-bucket:
    type: aws:s3:Bucket
    properties:
      website:
        indexDocument: index.html
```

Now add two properties to the `BucketObject`: an ACL of `public-read` so that it can be accessed anonymously over the Internet, and a content type ensure it's served as HTML:

```yaml
resources:
  # ...
  index.html:
    type: aws:s3:BucketObject
    properties:
      bucket: ${my-bucket}
      source:
        Fn::FileAsset: ./index.html
      acl: public-read
      contentType: text/html
```

Finally, at the end of the file, export the resulting bucket’s endpoint URL so you can access it easily:

```yaml
# ...
outputs:
  bucketName: ${my-bucket.id}
  bucketEndpoint: http://${my-bucket.websiteEndpoint}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Now update your stack to have your S3 bucket serve your `index.html` file as a static website.

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

First, you will see a preview of your changes:

```
Previewing update (dev):

     Type                    Name            Plan       Info
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack     quickstart-dev
 ~   ├─ aws:s3:Bucket        my-bucket           update     [diff: +website]
 ~   └─ aws:s3:BucketObject  index.html          update     [diff: ~acl,contentType]

Outputs:
  + bucketEndpoint: output<string>

Resources:
    ~ 2 to update
    1 unchanged

```

Select `yes` to deploy both changes:

Outputs:
  + bucketEndpoint: "http://my-bucket-b9c2eaa.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
    bucketName    : "my-bucket-b9c2eaa"

Resources:
    ~ 2 updated
    1 unchanged

Duration: 12s
```

Finally, you can check out your new static website at the URL in the `Outputs` section of your update or you can make a `curl` request and see the contents of your `index.html` object printed out in your terminal.

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucketEndpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucketEndpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucket_endpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucketEndpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucketEndpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucketEndpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```bash
$ curl $(pulumi stack output bucketEndpoint)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

And you should see:

```bash
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, Pulumi!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Next you will destroy the resources.
