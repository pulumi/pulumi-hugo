Drift Detection is the process of identifying changes in the actual state of your cloud environment that deviate from the expected configuration stored in Pulumi Cloud. This can occur when an operator makes an out-of-band change directly in the cloud provider console, bypassing the usual code deployment processes.

## Configuring Drift Detection

### Pulumi Cloud UI

### REST API

### Pulumi Cloud Service provider

### Configuring notifications for Drift Detection
