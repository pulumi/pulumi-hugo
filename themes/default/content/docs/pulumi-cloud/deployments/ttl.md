Every Platform Team is familiar with the challenge of managing infrastructure that's easy to spin up but often forgotten, leading to inflated costs and operational burden to manage. Time to Live (TTL) Stacks in Pulumi Cloud enable the automated management of stack lifecycles by specifying a predefined duration after which the stacks are automatically terminated. This feature is essential for managing ephemeral environments, such as development and testing setups, which do not require permanent infrastructure and can benefit from automatic decommissioning to avoid unnecessary costs and resource usage.
