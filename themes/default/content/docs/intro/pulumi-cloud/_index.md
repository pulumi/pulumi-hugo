[Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com) is a secure cloud service for individuals and teams using Pulumi's open-source SDK. It manages deployment state and secrets, enables search across your clouds, runs deployments, integrates with CI/CD, and enforces policies and access controls.

The Pulumi CLI automatically uses the Pulumi Cloud unless you use a [self-managed backend](/docs/intro/concepts/state/).

## Getting Started

In your browser, navigate to <a href="https://app.pulumi.com" target="_blank">app.pulumi.com</a> and create an account.

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://app.pulumi.com/signup" target="_blank">Create an Account</a>

When you sign in to the Pulumi Cloud, a personal account is automatically
created on the **Individual** Edition. The Pulumi Individual Edition is free forever for unlimited individual use.

You can create an unlimited number of stacks, encrypt configuration and resource secrets, and browse stack history. To collaborate with other developers or use advanced features like [SAML SSO](/docs/guides/saml/), you'll need to create a Pulumi [organization](/docs/intro/pulumi-cloud/organizations/).
