The Pulumi Console offers role-based access control (RBAC) using teams. Teams allow organization admins to assign a set of stack permissions
to a group of users.

## Team Roles

Members of a team can be granted `Team admin` or `Team member` permissions. Team admins can add members to a
team. Both team admins and team members can grant stack access to a team. By default, any new team members will be
assigned the team member role. To change a team member's role, use the ellipsis menu item at the end of the table row.

### Creating a Team{#creating-a-team}

To give members permission to create teams..
1. Navigate to the organization **Settings**
1. Navigate to **Access Management**

#### GitHub-based Teams

If your Pulumi organization is backed by GitHub, you can import your existing
GitHub teams into Pulumi.

For these teams, membership is managed on GitHub, while the set of stack
permissions granted to team members is managed on the Pulumi Console.

## Team / Stack Permissions

Membership within a team will grant a Pulumi user a specific permission level for each
stack in the team. For example, members of `network-team` may have `Stack write` access to the
`backend/production` stack, but only `Stack read` access to `datastore/production`.
