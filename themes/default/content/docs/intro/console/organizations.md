Organizations are a space for you to collaborate on shared projects and stacks.

### Organization Pages

| Console Page | Description |

## Creating an Organization

To create an organization:

1. Select the organization menu at the top of the page.
1. Select **New organization...**
1. Provide an organization name, and agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.
1. Select **Start free trial**.

## Organization Access

To become a member of a Pulumi organization, you must be invited by an existing Pulumi
organization administrator, or you must submit a request to the administrator for approval.
In addition, depending you may also need to be a member of the third-party organization or group backing the Pulumi organization.

For example, to become a member of a Pulumi organization backed by a GitLab Group,
you must associate a GitLab identity with your Pulumi account, and also
be a member of that GitLab group.

## Moving Between Organizations

The Organization drop-down list displays all of the organizations your account is
associated with, and lets you add a new organization backed by a third
party identity provider.

To switch to a different organization:

1. Select the organization drop-down list in the upper left corner of the Console screen
next to the Pulumi logo.
1. Select your organization name.

## Organization Roles

| Role | Description |
|--------|--------|
| Admin | Administrators have full access to the organization including: [Inviting members]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/organization-roles#organization-membership" >}}), [creating teams]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/teams#creating-a-team" >}}) and policies, managing [stack permissions]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/stack-permissions" >}}) and [role-based access control]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/organization-roles" >}}), adjusting billing information and controlling the organization settings. |
| Member | Members are able to view and edit stacks they have access to and view members and teams. |

## Organization Identity Providers

A Pulumi organization can use the Pulumi identity provider or a third-party identity provider.
If using a third-party identity provider all members need to be a member of the third-party
identity provider in order to join a Pulumi organization.

For example, if a Pulumi organization, is backed by a GitHub organization, then only members
of that GitHub organization may be added to the Pulumi organization. Similarly, as soon as
someone loses access to the GitHub organization, they will no longer have access to the
Pulumi organization.

In addition, a Pulumi organization can be backed by a [SAML 2.0 identity provider]({{<
relref "/docs/guides/saml" >}}).

### Changing Identity Providers

Every organization is backed by an identity that governs the membership to your organization.
By default, when you create a new Pulumi organization, it uses the Pulumi identity provider.

Only organization admins can change the organization identity provider.

To change an organization's identity provider:

1. Navigate to the organization's **Settings**.
1. Navigate to **Access Management**.
1. Select **Change requirements**.

### GitHub Identity Provider

[Setting up a GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)

To add a GitHub organization to Pulumi, an admin of the GitHub organization
must first grant the Pulumi OAuth app the [`read:org` scope](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/7cf9078f3c92b17a5f0f).
This is required to verify memberships within the GitHub organization.
The Pulumi Console will not have access to any of the organization's source code, issues, or other data.

### GitLab Identity Provider

[GitLab Groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/group/)

To add a GitLab-backed organization to Pulumi, an admin of the GitLab group
must add the group to Pulumi, and invite its members to join Pulumi.

GitLab allows group admins to add members with a expiration value. In order to invite
those members to Pulumi, their membership in the GitLab group must still be active. As
soon as their GitLab group membership expires, those users will lose access to Pulumi organization.

### Bitbucket Identity Provider

[BitBucket Workspaces](https://bitbucket.org/blog/introducing-workspaces)

To add a Bitbucket-backed organization to Pulumi, an admin of the Atlassian
Bitbucket workspace
must first grant the Pulumi Oauth app [read
access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html#OAuthonBitbucketCloud-Scopes)
to their Bitbucket account and workspace membership information.

Once the Pulumi organization has been created, the admin can see a list of Bitbucket workspace
members that they can add or invite to the Pulumi organization.

### SAML Single Sign-on (SSO)

Pulumi Enterprise provides support for any SAML 2.0-based identity provider.
