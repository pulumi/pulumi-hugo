The `protect` resource option marks a resource as protected. A protected resource cannot be deleted directly, and it will be an error to do a Pulumi deployment which tries to delete a protected resource for any reason. 

To delete a protected resource, it must first be *unprotected*.  There are two was to unprotect a resource:

* Set `protect: false` and then run `pulumi up`
* Use the [`pulumi state unprotect`]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_state_unprotect" >}}) command

Once the resource is unprotected, it can be deleted as part of a following update.

The default is to inherit this value from the parent resource, and `false` for resources without a parent.
