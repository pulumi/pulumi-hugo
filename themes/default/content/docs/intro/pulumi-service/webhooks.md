{{% notes "info" %}}
Pulumi Webhooks is a feature available on the Pulumi Team, Enterprise and Business Critical editions.
To try it out, start a [trial](https://app.pulumi.com/site/trial) now.
{{% /notes %}}

Pulumi Webhooks allow you to notify external services of events
happening within your Pulumi organization. For example,
you can trigger a notification whenever a stack is updated.
Whenever an event occurs, Pulumi will send an HTTP `POST` request to
all registered webhooks. The webhook can then be used to emit a
notification, start running integration tests, or even update additional stacks.

Webhooks can be used for pretty much anything you want, and are the foundation
of most _ChatOps_ workflows.

## Management

Webhooks can be attached to either a stack or an organization. Stack webhooks
will be notified whenever a stack is updated or changed. Organization
webhooks will be notified for events happening within each of the organization's
stacks.

{{% notes "info" %}}
There are some restrictions on the number of webhooks that can be registered
when using the Pulumi Team editions. [Contact us](/contact/)
if you need the limit increased.

The Webhooks management page is on the Stack or Organization Settings tab.

### Create a Webhook

To create an organization webhook:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
1. Select **Create webhook**.
1. Provide a _Display Name_, _Payload URL_, and optionally a _Secret_.

To create a stack webhook:

1. Navigate to the stack.
1. Then navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**
1. Select **Create webhook**.
1. Provide a _Display Name_, _Payload URL_, and optionally a _Secret_.

If a secret is provided, webhook deliveries will contain a signature
in the HTTP request header that can be used to authenticate messages as coming from
the Pulumi Service.

## Event Notifications

The following events will be emitted to webhooks registered to a stack or an organization.
Organization-level webhooks will be sent webhook events from all of the stacks within
that organization.

| Event Kind | Triggered |
| --- | --- |
| `stack_update` | Whenever a stack is updated. |
| `stack_preview` | Whenever a stack update is previewed. |

The following events are only delivered to organization-based webhooks.

| Event Kind | Triggered |
| --- | --- |
| `stack` | Whenever a stack is created or deleted within an organization. |

## Payloads

Each webhook payload has a format specific to the payload being emitted. Every payload will contain a sender, organization,
and stack reference as appropriate. For examples of specific payloads, see _Payload Reference_ below.

Each webhook will contain a `user` field, which is the user who requested the action, an `organization` which is
the organization name, and a URL for the event. It will also contain the `stackName` for the stack which was modified when applicable.

### Headers

Payloads contain several headers.

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Pulumi-Webhook-ID` | Unique ID for each webhook sent which you can reference when looking at delivery logs in the Pulumi Service. |
| `Pulumi-Webhook-Kind` | The kind of webhook event, e.g. `stack_update`. |
| `Pulumi-Webhook-Signature` | Only set if the webhook has a shared secret. HMAC hex digest of the request payload, using the `sha256` hash function and the webhook secret as the HMAC key. |

The following snippets show how to compute and verify the webhook signature.
For examples in other languages, see [danharper/hmac-examples](https://github.com/danharper/hmac-examples).

{{< chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go" >}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```javascript
var crypto = require('crypto');

const sharedSecret = ...
const payload = req.body.toString();

var hmacAlg = crypto.createHmac('sha256', sharedSecret);
var expectedSignature = hmac.update(payloadBody).digest('hex');
```

{{% /choosable %}}
{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```typescript
import * as crypto from "crypto";

const sharedSecret = ...
const payload = req.body.toString();

const hmacAlg = crypto.createHmac("sha256", stackConfig.sharedSecret);
const hmac = hmacAlg.update(payload).digest("hex");

const result = crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(webhookSig), Buffer.from(hmac));
```

{{% choosable language python %}}

```python

import hmac
import base64

message = bytes('...', 'utf-8')
secret = bytes('...', 'utf-8')

hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)
hash.hexdigest()

expected_signature = base64.b64encode(hash.digest())
```

{{% /choosable %}}
{{% choosable language go %}}

```go
func computeSignature(payload []byte, secret string) string {
	mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secret))
	_, err := mac.Write(payload)
	contract.AssertNoErrorf(err, "computing HMAC digest")
	return fmt.Sprintf("%x", mac.Sum(nil))
}
```

## Payload Examples

Most payloads contain `user` and `organization` fields. `user` contains the
identity of the user who triggered the webhook. For example, the person who initiated
the stack update or performed the action.
