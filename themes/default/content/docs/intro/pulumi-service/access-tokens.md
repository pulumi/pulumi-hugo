## Access Tokens

This tab lets you manage the [access tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token) used for logging into the Pulumi service. It provides a list of all the access tokens associated with your account, including a description and last used information for each token.

When you run [`pulumi login`]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_login" >}}) from the command line, you will be prompted for an access token. Once obtained, the access token logs you into the Pulumi Service and lets you interact with the Pulumi service and manage your stacks.
