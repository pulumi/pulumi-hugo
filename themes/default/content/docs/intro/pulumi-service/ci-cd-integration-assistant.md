The CI/CD integration assistant helps you integrate Pulumi into CI/CD systems for automatically deploying stacks and is only available
on [Organizations]({{< relref "/docs/intro/pulumi-service/organizations" >}}), not personal accounts.

<!--more-->

A version control system (VCS) provides team collaboration capabilities and ensures that the source code for your Pulumi project is not
just on a single developer's machine. Using a CI/CD system makes your team more productive, by automatically deploying your Pulumi stacks.
So that code is delivered to production -- meaning less of a lag between commits and what your end users are seeing.

The assistant contains a guided experience to help teams configure a VCS as well as automate it with a
CI/CD pipeline.

The assistant has two options to help you to get started with integrations:

* Use a single service that provides both a version control system and CI/CD pipelines
* Or, just get the starter workflow for a CI/CD service of your choice customized for your stack

The assistant also offers best practice hints for stacks that do not have a VCS configuration.
Here's how the assistant helps teams throughout the Console:

* The dashboard page shows recently updated stacks. The assistant alerts users by providing a quick navigation link to configure a VCS
for any stacks that don't have it.

* The **Activity** page for a stack allows users to scan the page quickly and tell which of the updates were run from a
CI/CD pipeline and which ones were not.

## Using The Same Service For VCS and CI/CD

There are several benefits for a team to choose a single service for all of their team collaboration needs.
This section reviews how the assistant helps your team configure VCS and CI/CD regardless of the VCS or identity provider
you use to connect to Pulumi.

### Configuring a VCS

VCS configuration applies to the Pulumi project in which your stack is created.

{{% notes "info" %}}
If your identity isn't tied to a VCS service (for example, if you're using SAML or email), you will still be able to get a customized CI/CD
workflow for your stack.

#### VCS Identity Options

Services such as Atlassian Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab offer both a version control system as well as a CI/CD service.

* Bitbucket offers [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines/)
* GitHub has [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* GitLab has [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/)

This might be a convenient option if your team wishes to keep everything related to your Pulumi project on a single service.

To configure VCS using the CI/CD Assistant:

1. Select a VCS identity, and CI/CD pipeline.
1. Navigate to the link provided by the assistant.
1. Create a new repository using your selected service.
1. Follow the VCS configuration instructions and check off the boxes as you complete each step.
1. After each step, select the **Next** button to move to the next step.

### Configure CI/CD secrets

Now that your Pulumi project is configured to use a VCS your team can collaborate with you easily.
Most importantly, your Pulumi project is safe from accidents on your local machine!

If you start the CI/CD integration assistant having configured the VCS for your project already,
the assistant will skip to the next step automatically. You can see the repository that your project
is integrated with by selecting the **Configure VCS** step marker.

The **Configure CI/CD** step will help you configure secrets that will be used by your Pulumi stack.
For supported services, the assistant will provide a convenient link to the respective location
where you can configure the secrets.

The assistant provides a convenient way to create a [Pulumi access token]({{< ref "/docs/intro/pulumi-service/accounts#access-tokens" >}})
without needing to leave the page.

In the following example the assistant is being used to configure a GitHub Actions workflow.
So the assistant provides a direct link to configure secrets for your workflow.

> See the [Registry]({{< relref "/registry" >}}) page to find the setup page for your cloud provider.

### Add the workflow

Once the secrets are configured, the next step gives you the relevant workflow to add to your repository.
The workflow is customized for the current stack, so you can be sure that you are configuring a workflow that uses
the correct stack configuration.

{{% notes "info" %}}
Be sure to commit the new workflow file to a separate branch and not directly to your primary branch. This will create a new pull request for you.
{{% /notes %}}

The workflow configuration provided by the assistant is configured to run a `pulumi preview` for pull request builds.
Pull request builds help you catch problems _before_ the changes are merged -- a very important consideration for infrastructure
that is likely hosting services critical to your business.

### Validation

In the previous step, you committed a new workflow configuration by creating a new pull request. This will trigger a new build
that will run the `pulumi preview` command. Select the **Next** button to validate the CI configuration.

Congratulations on configuring a version control system and an automated pipeline for your stack! ðŸŽ‰

If your pull request build failed, use the [CI/CD troubleshooting guide]({{< relref "/docs/guides/continuous-delivery/troubleshooting-guide" >}}) to diagnose the issue.

## Skip the line and get the workflow directly

If you want to access the workflow for a specific CI/CD service and configure VCS on your own,
you can do that by selecting a service from the drop-down to get started. You will
still get a workflow template that is customized to your stack.

{{% notes "info" %}}
This option is more suitable for teams that want to use different services for their VCS repo and CI/CD needs. For example, you want
to be able to use Azure Pipelines with a GitHub repository and just want the workflow template for Azure Pipelines.
