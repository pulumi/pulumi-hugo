Kat Cosgrove is a Developer Advocate, a CNCF Ambassador, and an actual cyborg. Her professional background has run the gamut from bartender, to video store clerk, to teacher, to software developer. She credits this wide-ranging experience for her success as a speaker, developer, and advocate. Her specialty is approachable 101-level content for junior developers or anyone else who considers themselves a newbie, with a particular focus on DevOps.

When she's not building demos or at a conference, she spends her time playing video games, watching horror movies, and reading science fiction. She lives in Seattle with her cat, Espresso, who is the real brains behind the operation and actually ghostwriting all of her tweets.
