    description: |
        The Pulumi Service is the easiest way to use Pulumi open source at scale, enabling infrastructure and development teams to focus on building, deploying, and managing modern cloud applications faster and reliably. It is a managed service that handles infrastructure state and secrets, sets up SAML SSO, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and enforces compliance rules.

    description: |
        Pulumi Service is a managed service for the open source CLI and SDK. It tracks your [infrastructure’s state](/docs/intro/concepts/state/) and coordinates updates with the CLI, which creates or updates resources to reach your infrastructure’s [desired state](/docs/intro/concepts/how-pulumi-works/).

        You can also use any cloud or on-premises storage to build and [run your own backend](/docs/intro/concepts/state/#logging-into-a-self-managed-backend).
