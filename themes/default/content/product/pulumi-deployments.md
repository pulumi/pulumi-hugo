overview:
    title: The fastest way to go from code to cloud
    description: |
        [Pulumi Deployments](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/) is a fast and flexible way to deploy infrastructure on any cloud and at any scale, using GitHub pull requests, API calls, and console. No CLI setup needed since [Pulumi Cloud](/product/pulumi-cloud/) manages deployments.

            “Pulumi allows every engineer to build and update infrastructure instead of only our infrastructure team. With Pulumi Deployments, we could easily set up a standardized CI/CD infrastructure workflow for every engineer that immediately makes them productive.”

            “I’m making developers at Alkira significantly more productive while also making my job easier using Pulumi. I can get developers using IaC immediately with Pulumi Deployments and its GitHub integration, while Pulumi Insights makes it really easy to find idle developer environments that need to be shut down, which reduces our cloud costs.”

    title: How will Pulumi Deployments benefit me?
    description: |
        Pulumi Deployments makes it easier for you and engineers on your team to collaborate on infrastructure changes and deploy changes automatically through your existing GitHub pull request workflow. There is minimal setup and you can standardize your deployment workflow through GitHub and Pulumi. In addition, you can build your own custom deployment workflows with [Automation API](/docs/using-pulumi/automation-api/) code and offload the deployment workload to Pulumi Deployments instead of running it locally with the Pulumi CLI. Pulumi Deployments is based on the same technology as [Pulumi Automation API](/docs/using-pulumi/automation-api/).
