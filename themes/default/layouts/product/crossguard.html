                <h3>“Shift Left” policy enforcement and standards remediation</h3>
                <p>
                    Programmatic policy enforcement and remediation is key to scaling securely and efficiently because inconsistent infrastructure could lead to compromise. Pulumi CrossGuard offers centralized policy enforcement and remediation as an integrated component of Pulumi’s infrastructure as code platform. Take advantage of well-known and well-understood programming languages like TypeScript and Python to author policies, and apply them across multiple clouds, SaaS offerings, and application platforms. Pull from a library of ready-made policies that can be customized to your organization’s specific needs and goals. CrossGuard ensures consistent application of your policies, and prevents new misconfigurations or inconsistencies from being introduced into your infrastructure.

                        With Pulumi CrossGuard, you can enforce a wide range of policies and overall best practices. Here are several common use cases:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Best Practices Enforcement: Enforce architectural and operational best practices, such as ensuring tagging for resource tracking and cost allocation, using specific versions of cloud services, or adhering to naming conventions across your infrastructure. Take advantage of <a href="/docs/using-pulumi/crossguard/awsguard/">AWSGuard</a>, an open source library of best practices for AWS. </li>
                        <li>Security and Compliance Policies: Pulumi <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/compliance-policies/">Compliance-Ready Policies</a> make it easy to create policy packs for enforcing common security and compliance policies (PCI DSS, ISO 27001 and CIS) across a broad range of cloud providers. You can also create your own policies to ensure encryption is enabled on storage accounts and databases.</li>
                        <li>Cost Management Policies: Pulumi <a href="/blog/manage-infrastructure-with-pac/#controlling-cost-on-aws">Control cloud costs</a> by setting policies that limit the size and type of resources, prevent provisioning of high-cost resources, and ensure that development environments are sized correctly. </li>

                    <p>
                        You can use off-the-shelf policies like <a href="/docs/using-pulumi/crossguard/awsguard/">AWSGuard</a> and the new <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/compliance-policies/">Pulumi compliance-ready policies</a> or write your own “policy pack” in one of the supported languages (currently JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, or Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego). A policy pack is a collection of policies that are just objects and functions that are given an opportunity to inspect the resource graph and report whether any policy violations have been detected. They’re packaged natively (such as NPM, PyPI, etc) and Pulumi runs the policies at the right time with the right data to enforce them.

                        <a href="/docs/using-pulumi/crossguard/awsguard/">AWSGuard</a> Remediation Policies remediate violations to actually fix the problems they find in addition to or instead of reporting them as violations. Just like normal policies, a remediation is given a resource’s state for inspection. If the policy finds a problem, it can fix that state in place, and return it, and the engine will use the remediated state in place of the original state produced by the Pulumi program. Remediation policies are great for many use cases. Here are a few examples:
