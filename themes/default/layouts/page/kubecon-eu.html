                        The cloud native landscape is notoriously vast, and there is no hope of one human ever
                        understanding every piece of it. Perhaps you should just quit now! Or instead,
                        join Matty and Whitney on a journey with three fictional learners who are all trying
                        to level up their Kubernetes knowledge, but with different backgrounds, goals, and
                        learning styles. They will share resources and learning strategies that are beneficial
                        to each. Anecdotal stories about how some real-life, well-known Kubernetes community
                        members got their start will be sprinkled in along the way! The goal is not to give a
                        comprehensive view of the Kubernetes learning landscape but instead to leave you feeling
                        empowered to define your own personal learning strategies and goals, and then to seek out
                        the resources that will best help you!
