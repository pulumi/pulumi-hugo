When developing locally, we recommend that you install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) and then [authorize access with a user
account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorizing_with_a_user_account). If `gcloud` is not configured to interact with your Google Cloud project, set it with the
`config` command using the project's ID: ```bash gcloud config set project
<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
    ``` Next, Pulumi requires default application credentials to interact with your Google Cloud resources, so run `auth application-default login` command to obtain those
    credentials: ```bash $ gcloud auth application-default login ```</YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID
>
