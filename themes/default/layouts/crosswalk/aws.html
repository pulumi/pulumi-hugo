                            Provision services that are Well-Architected by default. Benefit
                            from patterns that worked for customers who have gone to
                            production. Easy to get started, and easy to do the right thing.

                            Best in class productivity means you can rapidly deploy
                            applications and infrastructure, with the confidence that what you
                            build is production ready out-of-the-box.

                        <p>
                            Pulumi's unique approach to infrastructure as code uses familiar
                            languages you already know and love, meaning you can use your
                            favorite tools and engineering practices.

                    <h3>Containers and Serverless</h3>
                    <p>
                        Get up and running on "day one" with containers -- using Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service (ECS), including "Fargate" or Kubernetes
                        (EKS) -- or serverless -- using AWS Lambda or API Gateway. Benefit
                        from secure and reliable defaults, and customize only where you
                        need to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Pulumi's unique approach to infrastructure as code, you'll
                        focus more on code and business logic, and less on YAML or DSL
                        configuration languages.

                    <p>
                        Create, manage, and integrate "day two and beyond" infrastructure
                        for security, networking, clusters, and monitoring. Instead of
                        relearning best practices time and time again, use hardened
                        packages that automatically encapsulate Well-Architected patterns
                        and practices.

                    <p>
                        Pulumi's unique approach to infrastructure as code means you can
                        leverage highly configurable and extensible components to enforce
                        best practices within your team.

                        We've been happily using Pulumi’s EKS support for more than three months
                        now. Our team was looking for an end-to-end solution to tame the
                        complexity of Kubernetes on AWS and ensure we adhere to AWS best
                        practices. Pulumi’s Crosswalk effort has equipped our team to scale far
                        better than the alternative approaches of home-grown solutions, scripts
                        and DSLs. Our delivery is now automated and we can now deliver new
                        application and infrastructure features with much faster turn-around,
                        sometimes in just a few hours. Pulumi is a key contributor to our team’s
                        improvement in productivity.
