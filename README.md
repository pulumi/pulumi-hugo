# pulumi-hugo

A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) module containing the Pulumi Hugo theme and website content.

This repository is consumed by https://github.com/pulumi/docs to produce the website you see at https://pulumi.com. If you're interested in contributing some docs or a blog post at https://pulumi.com/blog, you've come to the right place! ðŸ™Œ

## Contributing

First, be sure to read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and review our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Toolchain

We build the Pulumi website statically with Hugo, manage our Node.js dependencies with Yarn, and write most of our documentation in Markdown. Below is a list of the tools you'll need to run the website locally:

* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

### CSS and JavaScript Tools

We also use a handful of tools for compiling and managing our CSS and JavaScript assets, including:

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

You don't need to install these tools individually or globally; the scripts below will handle everything for you. But if you'd like to contribute any CSS or JavaScript, you'll probably want to understand how to work with each of these tools as well.

## Installing prerequisites

Run `make ensure` to check for the appropriate tools and versions and install any dependencies. The script will let you know if you're missing anything important.

```
make ensure
```

## Running Hugo locally

Once you've run `make ensure` successfully, you're ready to run the development server. If you're only planning on writing Markdown or working with Hugo layouts, this command should be all you need:

```
make serve
```

You can browse the development server at http://localhost:1313, and any changes you make to content or layouts should be reloaded automatically.

## Running Hugo with CSS and JavaScript support

If you plan on making changes to CSS or JavaScript files, you'll probably want to use this command instead:

```
make serve-all
```

The `serve-all` target runs Hugo, node-sass, and the Stencil development server concurrently, allowing you to make changes to Sass files, Stencil components, or TypeScript/JavaScript source files, and have those changes compiled and reloaded automatically as well.

## Tidying up

To clear away any module caches or build artifacts, run:

```
make clean
```

## About this repository

This repository is a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) that doubles as a development server. **It does not contain every page of the Pulumi website**, because most of those pages (e.g., those comprising our CLI and SDK docs) are generated from source code, so they aren't meant to be edited by humans directly.

Because of this, many of the links you follow when browsing around on the development server (to paths underneath `/docs/reference` for example) will fail to resolve because their content files are are checked into a different repository &mdash; most likely https://github.com/pulumi/docs. When we build the Pulumi website, we merge this module along with any others into a single build artifact, but when you're working within an individual module like this one, you may find you're unable to reach certain pages or verify the links you may want to make to them.

If you want to link to a page that exists on https://pulumi.com but not in this repository, just use the page's **relative path** with a [Hugo `relref`](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#ref-and-relref) in the usual way, and we'll make sure all links resolve properly at build-time. For example, to link to the [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/digitalocean/droplet/) page (a page that doesn't exist in this repository but that would exist in an integration build), you'd use:

```
{{< relref /docs/reference/pkg/digitalocean/droplet >}}
```

This works because we've suppressed Hugo's built-in `relref` validation to keep the module-development workflow as lightweight as possible.

### What's in this repo

* All hand-authored content and documentation, including top-level pages, guides, blog posts, and some tutorials
* Most Hugo module components, including archetypes, layouts, partials, shortcodes, data, etc.

You'll find all of these files in `themes/current`.

### What's not in this repo

* Generated documentation for the Pulumi CLI and SDK. You'll find this at https://github.com/pulumi/docs).
* Generated tutorials. You'll find these at https://github.com/pulumi/examples).
* Templates used for generating resource documentation. You'll find these at https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi.

## Merging and releasing

When a pull request is merged into the default branch of this repository, a follow-up PR is triggered on [pulumi/docs](https://github.com/pulumi/docs) that produces an integration build comprised of the full website. Once that build completes and is approved and merged into pulumi/docs, the changes are deployed to pulumi.com.

## Blogging

## Shortcodes and web components

We use number of Hugo shortcodes and web components in our pages. You can read more about many of them in the [components README](themes/current/components).
