# pulumi-hugo

A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) module containing content and layouts used on pulumi.com, including hand-authored docs, the Pulumi blog, and Learn Pulumi.

This repository is consumed by https://github.com/pulumi/docs to produce the website you see at https://pulumi.com. If you're interested in contributing some docs or a blog post at https://pulumi.com/blog, you've come to the right place! 🙌

## Contributing

First, be sure to read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and review our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Toolchain

We build the Pulumi website statically with Hugo, manage our Node.js dependencies with Yarn, and write most of our documentation in Markdown. Below is a list of the tools you'll need to run the website locally:

* [Go](https://golang.org/) (>= 1.15)
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (>= 0.92)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 1.14)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) (1.x)

### VS Code devcontainer

Alternatively you can use the [devcontainer environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) included in this repo. Open this folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and run the `Remote-Containers: Reopen in container` command in the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

Within the container you can run the various make commands explained below. Port 1313 is forwarded into the container so you can use your normal browser to access the results of `make serve` or `make serve-all` at http://localhost:1313.

## Installing prerequisites

Run `make ensure` to check for the appropriate tools and versions and install any dependencies. The script will let you know if you're missing anything important.

```
make ensure
```

## Running Hugo locally

Once you've run `make ensure` successfully, you're ready to run the development server. If you're only planning on writing Markdown or working with Hugo layouts, this command should be all you need:

```
make serve
```

If you are planning on making CSS or JS changes you will need to run:

```
make serve-all
```

You can browse the development server at http://localhost:1313, and any changes you make to content or layouts should be reloaded automatically.

## Linting and formatting

To check your code and your Markdown files for issues before submitting, run:

```
make lint
```

This repo uses Prettier for code formatting, to keep styling + formatting issues aligned without the need to be reviewed in PRs.  To see what files have formatting diffs, you can run `make format` from the project root, which will update all files to conform to our formatting standards.  To check the diffs without fixing them, a check runs as part of `make lint`.

Prettier is easiest to use when you run it automatically on save in your editor - see the docs here: https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html.  If you set your editor to format on save, you should be staying aligned with formatting without needing to run any of the above commands.

## Tidying up

To clear away any module caches or build artifacts, run:

```
make clean
```

## About this repository

This repository is a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) that doubles as a development server. **It does not contain every page of the Pulumi website**, because most of those pages (e.g., those comprising our CLI and SDK docs) are generated from source code, so they aren't meant to be edited by humans directly.

Because of this, many of the links you follow when browsing around on the development server (to paths underneath `/docs/reference` for example) will fail to resolve because they originate from another repository &mdash; most likely https://github.com/pulumi/docs or https://github.com/pulumi/registry. When we build the Pulumi website, we merge this module along with any others into a single build artifact, but when you're working within an individual module like this one, you may find you're unable to reach certain pages or verify the links you may want to make to them.

If you want to link to a page that exists on https://pulumi.com but not in this repository, use the page's path **starting at the root** in a Markdown or HTML link. For example, in a Markdown file, to link to the [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/digitalocean/droplet/) page (a page that doesn't exist in this repository, but that would exist in an integration build), you'd use:

```markdown
[Digital Ocean Droplet](/docs/reference/pkg/digitalocean/droplet/)
```

We used to recommend using `{{ relref }}` for these links, which are checked in the build for https://github.com/pulumi/docs; however, this often caused confusion because when a link was incorrect, the failure would not be obviously connected to a change here. For a detailed explanation see [#2701](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-hugo/pull/2071).

### What's in this repo

* All hand-authored content and documentation, including top-level pages, guides, blog posts, and some tutorials
* Most Hugo module components, including archetypes, layouts, partials, shortcodes, data, etc.
* All the SCSS, TS, and Stencil files used to build our CSS/JSS assets.

You'll find all of these files in `themes/default`.

### What's not in this repo

* Generated documentation for the Pulumi CLI and SDK. You'll find this at https://github.com/pulumi/docs.
* Generated tutorials. You'll find these at https://github.com/pulumi/examples).
* Templates used for generating resource documentation. You'll find these at https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi.

## Merging and releasing

When a pull request is merged into the `master` branch of this repository, the content of the pull request isn't published immediately. Instead, it's published at some point later, typically as a result of an [hourly GitHub Actions job in pulumi/docs](https://github.com/pulumi/docs/actions/workflows/update-theme.yml) that checks this repository and others for new content. When that hourly job finds new content to be published, it creates a new pull request (or updates an existing one) on pulumi/docs, builds and tests a full site preview, and merges that pull request automatically after the tests pass, triggering the website to be republished.

The typical timeline looks something like this:

* 8:45 AM: A PR is merged into pulumi-hugo `master`.
* 9:00 AM: The [`Scheduled Jobs: Update Hugo modules`](https://github.com/pulumi/docs/actions/workflows/update-theme.yml) workflow runs in pulumi/docs.
* 9:05 AM: The workflow detects the newly merged pulumi-hugo content and generates a new PR on pulumi/docs.
* 9:30 AM: The pulumi/docs PR is automatically merged into `master`, triggering a redeployment of pulumi.com.
* 10:00 AM: The new content is live.

In other words, once the pulumi/docs PR is generated, it usually takes about an hour (half-hour for the PR build, another for the website deployment) for new content to appear on pulumi.com.

Note, however, that despite that we schedule the module-update job to run at the top of the hour, it often doesn't; delays of 20 minutes or more are unfortunately fairly common.

If having more direct control over release timing is important, you can opt to trigger the module-update job manually. To do that, [navigate to the workflow](https://github.com/pulumi/docs/actions/workflows/update-theme.yml) and choose **Run Workflow** to kick it off immediately:

The behavior in this case is no different than if you'd allowed the job to run on its own, and once it completes, the remaining steps will complete in the usual way.

## Style Guide

We try and align Pulumi documentation to the [Pulumi Docs Style Guide](STYLE-GUIDE.md).

## Shortcodes and web components

We use number of Hugo shortcodes and web components in our pages. You can read more about many of them in the [components README](https://github.com/pulumi/theme/tree/master/stencil).

## Search and Swiftype

Swiftype is how we manage our search experience for docs and Registry.  The [Swiftype docs](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/site_search) have a lot of useful information.  A few items to keep in mind if you are updating search results or behavior:

### Swiftype console

Visit the [Swiftype console](https://app.swiftype.com/) for information specific to our search implementation: the date and time of the most recent crawl, any customizations we have done of result rankings for specific search terms, synonyms we have set for specific search terms, or weighting of custom meta tags.

### Result rankings

[Swiftype rankings](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/guides/result-rankings) let us manually customize how results appear for any query.  Using the console, you can enter a query, and pin certain results to the top or delete results.


### Fields, meta tags, and weights

Fields are the set of places where the crawler extracts content from our pages.   There are a set of default fields (title, body, etc).  We can add fields by [adding custom meta tags](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/crawler-configuration/meta-tags), either in the head or the body of a document.  It's worth noting that these are different than SEO meta tags, and the crawler does not capture those meta tags. Once a custom field is added and has been re-crawled (about a day after code has been merged), we can use the field to adjust results using weights.

[Swiftype weights](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/guides/weights) are a way for us to impact search result relevance, by telling the engine that matches in a certain field of the document matter more than matches elsewhere.  In the Swiftype console, we can adjust the weights of any field.  By giving a certain field more weight, we can affect the ranking of search results.

### Synonyms

[Swiftype synonyms](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/guides/synonyms) allow us to connect common search terms to each other.  If we know some users refer to a provider as “ReallyAwesome,” but our docs use the name “RA”, we can set those as synonyms in our Swiftype console.  This will ensure that users get the same set of results using either term, and that those results are relevant regardless of which name we use in our docs.


### UI and Layout

Swiftype is opinionated about the layout of search results, search behavior, and the UI styling of the search box.  Within the Swiftype console, we can [customize elements](https://swiftype.com/documentation/site-search/guides/design-and-customization) such as the style of search results, the result count per page, or text colors.  In order to override the search input styles (text color, border styles, etc) we need to directly update our styles for the `st-default-search-input` class.
