# UX Standards

These standards include some basic user experience guidelines we align to on the marketing website, docs, and the registry.

- Every page should have exactly one primary action.
- Use descriptive text for button labels and links, and avoid labels such as "Learn more".
- Use unique labels for distrinct actions.
- Use existing components over creating new components unless you identify a need that is not addressed by the current components.
- Use line lengths between 45 â€“ 75 characters.
- Links should take you to another page, and buttons should take an action on the page.
- When possible links should look like links, and buttons should look like buttons.
